<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">HUSKS.<br />



BY MARION HARLAND.</h1>



<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">CHAPTER I.</p>


<p>It was a decided uncompromising rainy
day. There were no showers, coquetted
with by veering winds or dubious mists,
that at times grew brighter, as if the sun
were burning away their lining; but a uniform
expanse of iron-gray clouds&mdash;kept in
close, grim column by a steady, although
not violent east wind&mdash;sent straight lines of
heavy rain upon the earth. The naked
trees, that, during the earlier hours of the
deluge had seemed to shiver for the immature
leaf-buds, so unfit to endure the rough
handling of the storm, now held out still,
patient arms, the rising sap curdled within
their hearts. The gutters were brimming
streams, and the sidewalks were glazed
with thin sheets of water.</p>

<p>The block of buildings before which our
story pauses, was, as a glance would have
showed the initiated in the grades of Gotham
life, highly respectable, even in the
rain. On a clear day when the half-folded
blinds revealed the lace, silken and damask
draperies within, when young misses and
masters&mdash;galvanized show-blocks of purple
and fine linen, that would have passed
muster behind the plate-glass of Genin or
Madame Demorest&mdash;tripped after hoops or
promenaded the smooth pavement; when
pretty, jaunty one-horse carriages, and
more pretentious equipages, each with a
pair of prancing steeds, and two "outside
passengers" in broadcloth and tinsel hatbands,
received and discharged their loads
before the brown-stone fronts&mdash;had the
afore-mentioned spectator chanced to perambulate
this not spacious street, he would
have conceded to it some degree of the
fashion claimed for it by its inhabitants.
There were larger houses and wider pavements
to be had for the same price a few
blocks further on, in more than one direction,
but these were unanimously voted
"less eligible" and "deficient in style," in
spite of the fact that as good and better
materials were employed in their construction,
and they were in all respects equal in
external show and inside finish to those in
this model quarter. "But our block has a
certain air&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know what; but
it is just the thing, you know, and so convenient!
So near the avenue!" would be
the concluding argument.</p>

<p>The nameless, indescribable charm of the
locality lay in the last clause. "Just step
around the corner and you are in the avenue,"
said the favored dwellers in this vicinity,
as the climax in the description of
their abode, and "that way fashion lies" to
every right-minded New Yorker of the
feminine gender.</p>

<p>But the aristocratic quiet of the neighborhood,
rendered oppressive and depressing
by the gloom of the day, was disturbed
by a discordant sound&mdash;a child's cry,
and what was especially martyrizing to refined
auriculars, the lament had the unmistakable
plebeian accent. The passionate
scream with which the pampered darling
of the nursery resents interference with his
rights and liberty of tyranny or the angry
remonstrance of his injured playmates,
would have been quite another species of
natural eloquence, as regards both quality
and force, from the weak, broken wail that
sobbed along the wet streets. Moreover,
what respectable child could be abroad on
foot in this weather? So, the disrespectable
juvenile pursued her melancholy way
unnoticed and unquestioned until she
reached the middle of the square. There
a face appeared at a window in the second
story of a house&mdash;which only differed from
those to its right, left and opposite in the
number upon the door&mdash;vanished and in
half a minute more a young lady appeared
in the sheltered vestibule.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, little girl?"</p>

<p>The tone was not winning, yet the sobs
ceased, and the child looked up, as to a
friendly questioner. She was about eleven
years of age, if one had judged from her
size and form; but her features were
pinched into unnatural maturity. Her attire
was wretched, at its best estate; now,
soaked by the rain, the dingy hood drooped
over her eyes; the dark cotton shawl retained
not one of its original colors, and
the muddy dress flapped and dripped about
her ankles. Upon one foot she wore an old
cloth gaiter, probably picked up from an
ash heap; the remains of a more sorry
slipper were tied around the other.</p>

<p>"I am so cold and wet, and my matches is
all sp'ilt," she answered in a dolorous tone,
lifting the corner of a scrap of oil-cloth,
which covered a basket, tucked for further
security under her shawl.</p>

<p>"No wonder! What else could you expect,
if you would go out to sell them on a
day like this? Go down into the area,
there, and wait until I let you in."</p>

<p>The precaution was a wise one. No servant
in that well-regulated household would
have admitted so questionable a figure as
that which crept after their young mistress
into the comfortable kitchen. The
cook paused in the act of dissecting a chicken;
the butler&mdash;on carriage days the footman&mdash;checked
his flirtation with the plump
and laughing chambermaid, to stare at the
wretched apparition. The scrutiny of the
first named functionary was speedily diverted
to the dirty trail left by the intruder
upon the carpet. A scowl puckered
her red face, and her wrathful glance included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
both of the visitants as alike guilty
of this desecration of her premises. The
housemaid rolled up her eyes and clasped
her hands in dumb show of horror and
contempt to her gallant, who replied with
a shrug and a grin. But not a word of remonstrance
or inquiry was spoken. It was
rather a habit of this young lady's to have
her own way whenever she could, and that
she was bent upon doing this now was
clear.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said, bringing up a chair
to the fire.</p>

<p>The storm beaten wanderer obeyed, and
eagerly held up her sodden feet to the red
grate.</p>

<p>"Have you no better shoes than those?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Humph! Nor dress, nor shawl?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>A ray shot from the swollen eyes. "Yes,
ma'am."</p>

<p>The lady disappeared in the pantry and
presently returned with five or six slices
of bread and butter hastily cut and thickly
spread, with cheese and cold meat between
them.</p>

<p>"Eat!" She thrust them into the match-girl's
fingers. "Wait here, while I go and
look for some clothes for you."</p>

<p>As may be supposed, the insulted oracle
of kitchen mysteries improved the time of
the benefactress's absence by a very plain
expression of her sentiments towards beggars
in general, and this one in particular;
which harangue was received with applause
by her fellow-servants and perfect
equanimity by its object. She munched her
sandwiches with greedy satisfaction,
watching, the while, the little clouds of
steam that ascended from her heated toes.
She was, to all appearances, neither a
sensitive nor intelligent child, and had
known too much of animal want and suffering
to allow trifles to spoil her enjoyment
of whatever physical comfort fell to
her lot. Her mother at home could scold
quite as violently as the cook was now doing,
and she was more afraid of her anger,
because she beat while she berated her.
She was convinced that she stood in no
such peril here, for her protectress was one
in power.</p>

<p>"Have you eaten enough?" said the clear,
abrupt voice behind her, as she held two
sandwiches in her fingers, without offering
to put them to her lips.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. May I take 'em home?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you like. Stand up and
take off your shawl."</p>

<p>She put around the forlorn figure a thick
cloak, rusty and obsolete in fashion, but
which was a warm and ample covering for
the child, extending to the hem of her
dress. The damp elf-locks were hidden by
a knitted hood, and for the feet there were
stockings and shoes and a pair of India-rubbers
to protect these last from the water.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Humane Society of One,
when the refitting was at an end, "where
do you live? Never mind&mdash;I don't care to
know that yet! Here is a small umbrella&mdash;a
good one&mdash;which belongs to me. I have
no other for myself when I go out in bad
weather. I mean to lend it to you, to-day,
upon the condition that you will bring it
back to-morrow, or the first clear day.
Will you do it?"</p>

<p>The promise was readily given.</p>

<p>"Here's an old thing, Miss Sarah," ventured
the butler, respectfully, producing a
bulky, ragged cotton umbrella from a corner
of the kitchen closet. "It's risky&mdash;trusting
such as that with your nice silk
one."</p>

<p>"That will let in the rain, and it is entirely
too large for her to carry. You understand,
child? You are to bring this
safely back to me, the first time the sun
shines. Can you find your way to this
house again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, easy. Thank you,
ma'am!"</p>

<p>She dropped an awkward curtsey as Miss
Sarah held open the door for her to pass,
and went out into the rain&mdash;warm, dry and
shielded against further damage from the
storm.</p>

<p>Unheeding the significant looks of the
culinary cabinet, Sarah Hunt turned away
and ascended the stairs. She was a striking-looking
girl, although her features,
when in repose, could claim neither beauty
of form nor expression. Her complexion
was dark and pale, with a slight tinge of
olive, and her hair a deep brown, lips
whose compression was habitual, an aquiline
nose, and eyes that changed from
dreamy hazel to midnight blackness at the
call of mind or feeling, gave marked character
to her countenance. Her sententious
style of address to the child she had just
dismissed was natural, and usual to her in
ordinary conversation, as was also the
gravity, verging upon sombreness, which
had not once during the interview relaxed
into a smile.</p>

<p>The family sitting-room, her destination
at present, and to which we will take the
liberty of preceding her, was furnished
elegantly and substantially, and there,
leaning back in lounging chairs, were Miss
Lucy Hunt, the eldest daughter of the
household, and her bosom friend, Miss Victoria
West. Each held and wielded a crochet
needle, and had upon her lap a basket
of many-hued balls of double or single
zephyr worsted, or Shetland or Saxony
wool, or whatever was the fashionable article
for such pretty trifling at that date.
Miss West had completed one-quarter of a
shawl for herself, white and scarlet, and
her friend had made precisely the same
progress in the arduous manufacture of
one whose centre was white and its border
blue.</p>

<p>"Yours will be the prettiest," remarked
Lucy regretfully. "Blue never looks well
in worsteds. Why, I can't say, I'm sure.
It is too bad that I can wear so few other
colors. But I am such a fright in pink or
scarlet or any shade of red!"</p>

<p>"As if you could be a fright in anything,"
returned her companion, with seeming indignation.</p>

<p>Lucy smiled, showing a set of faultless
teeth that, to a stranger's first glance,
would have appeared by far the most attractive
point of her physiognomy. If
closer examination discovered that her skin
was pearly in whiteness and transparency,
that her form was exquisite, with a sort of
voluptuous grace; her hands worthy, in
shape and hue, to become a sculptor's model;
still, in the cold, unflattering light of
this rainy afternoon her want of color, her
light gray eyes, her yellow hair, drawn
straight back from the broad, low brow,
precluded the idea that she could ever,
with all the accessories of artificial glare,
dress and animation, be more than a merely
pretty girl. Miss West knew better, and
Lucy realized the power of her own charms
with full and complete complacency. Secure
in this pleasant self-appreciation, she
could afford to be careless as to her every-day
looks and home people. She saw and
enjoyed the manifest surprise of those who,
having seen her once in morning deshabille,
beheld her afterwards in elaborate evening
toilet. Then the abundant hair waved in
golden ripples about the classic head, the
most artfully simple of tasteful ornaments&mdash;a
camellia, a rosebud, or a pearl hairpin,
its sole adornment; her eyes, large, full and
soft, were blue instead of gray, while the
heat of the assembly-room, the excitement
of the crowd, or the exultation of gratified
vanity supplied the rounded cheek with
rich bloom and dewy vermillion to the lips.
But nature's rarest gift to her was her
voice, a mellow contralto, whose skillful
modulations stole refreshingly to the senses
amid the sharp clash of strained and
higher tones, the castanet-like jingle which
most American belles ring unmercifully into
the ears of their auditors. Lucy Hunt
was not "a great talker," still less was she
profound or brilliant when she did speak;
yet she invariably conveyed the impression
to the mind of a new acquaintance of a
thoroughly cultivated woman, one whose
acquirements were far beyond her modest
exhibition of thought and sentiment. The
most commonplace phrase came smoothly
and roundly from her tongue, and he was
censorious indeed who was willing to lose
the pleasure afforded by its musical utterance
in weighing its meaning. At school
she had never been diligent, except in the
study of music, and her painstaking in this
respect was rewarded by the reputation,
justly earned, of being the finest vocalist
in her circle of associates. In society she
shone as a rising star of the first magnitude;
at home she was happy, cheerful and
indolently amiable. Why should she be
otherwise? From her babyhood she had
been petted and admired by her family,
and the world&mdash;her world&mdash;was as ready
with its meed of the adulation which was
her element.</p>

<p>There were, besides the two sisters already
introduced to the reader, three other
children in the Hunt household&mdash;a couple of
sturdy lads, twelve and fourteen years of
age, and little Jeannie, a delicate child of
six, whom Lucy caressed with pet titles
and sugar-plums of flattery, and Sarah
served in secret and idolatrous fondness.
This family it was Mrs. Hunt's care and
pride to rear and maintain, not only in
comfort, but apparent luxury, upon the
salary which her husband received as
cashier of a prominent city bank, an income
sufficient to support them in modest
elegance, but which few besides Mrs. Hunt
could have stretched to cover the expense
of their ostensible style of living. But this
notable manager had learned economy in
excellent schools, primarily as a country
girl, whose holiday finery was purchased
with the proceeds of her own butter-making
and poultry-yard; then as the brisk,
lively wife of the young clerk, whose slender
salary had, up to the time of his marriage,
barely sufficed to pay for his own
board and clothes, and whose only vested
capital was his pen, his good character
and perfect knowledge of book-keeping.
But if his help-meet was a clever housewife,
she was likewise ambitious. With
the exception of the sum requisite for the
yearly payment of the premium upon Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Hunt's life insurance policy, their annual
expenses devoured every cent of their receipts.
Indeed, it was currently believed
among outsiders that they had other resources
than the cashier's wages, and Mrs.
Hunt indirectly encouraged the report that
she held property in her own right. They
lived "as their neighbors did," as "everybody
in their position in society was bound
to do," and "everybody" else was too intent
upon his personal affairs, too busy
with his private train of plans and operations
to examine closely the cogs and levers
and boilers of the locomotive Hunt. If
it went ahead, and kept upon the track
assigned it, was always "up to time," and
avoided unpleasant collisions, it was nobody's
business how the steam was gotten
up.</p>

<p>Every human plant of note has its parasite,
and Miss Lucy Hunt was not without
hers. There existed no reason in the
outward circumstances of the two girls
why Miss Hunt should not court Miss West
rather than Miss West toady Miss Hunt.
In a business&mdash;that is, a pecuniary&mdash;point
of view, the former appeared the more
likely state of the case, inasmuch as Victoria's
father was a stock-broker of reputed
wealth, and with a probable millionaireship
in prospective, if his future good
fortune equalled his past, while Mr. Hunt,
as has been stated, depended entirely upon
a certain and not an extravagant stipend.
But the girls became intimate at school,
"came out" the same winter at the same
party, where Lucy created a "sensation,"
and Victoria would have been overlooked
but for the sentimental connection between
the debutantes. Since then, although the
confidante would have scouted the imputation
of interested motives with virtuous
indignation of wounded affection, she had
nevertheless "made a good thing of it," as
her respected father would have phrased it,
by playing hanger-on, second fiddle, and
trumpeter general to the belle.</p>

<p>"As if you could be a fright in anything,"
she had said, naturally and perhaps
sincerely.</p>

<p>Lucy's smile was succeeded by a serious
look. "I am sadly tempted sometimes!
Those lovely peach-blossom hats that you
and Sarah wore this past winter were absolute
trials to my sense of right. And no
longer ago than Mrs. Crossman's party I
was guilty of the sin of coveting the complexion
that enabled Maria Johnston to
wear that sweet rose-colored silk, with the
lace skirt looped with rosebuds."</p>

<p>"You envy Maria Johnston's complexion?
Why don't you go further and fall in love
with her small eyes and pug nose?" inquired
Victoria, severely ironical. "I have
heard that people were never contented
with their own gifts, but such a case of
blindness as this has never before come
under my observation."</p>

<p>"No, no! I am not quite so humble with
regard to my personal appearance as you
would make out. Yet"&mdash;and the plaintive
voice might have been the murmur of a
grieving angel&mdash;"I think that there are
compensations in the lot of plain people
that we know nothing about. They escape
the censure and unkind remarks that uncharitable
and envious women heap upon
those who happen to be attractive. Now,
there is Sarah, who never cares a button
about her looks, so long as her hair is
smooth and her dress clean and whole.
She hates parties and is glad of any excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to stay out of the parlor when gentlemen
call. Give her her books and that
'snuggery,' as she calls it, of a room upstairs,
and she is happier than if she were
in the gayest company in the world. Who
criticises her? Nobody is jealous of her
face or manners or conversation. And she
would not mind it if they were."</p>

<p>"She has a more independent nature than
yours, my dear. I, for one, am rejoiced
that you two are unlike. I could not endure
to lose my darling friend, and somehow
I never could understand Sarah; never
could get near to her, you know."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder at that. It is just so
with me, sisters though we are. However,
Sarah means well, if her manner is blunt
and sometimes cold."</p>

<p>The entrance of the person under discussion
checked the conversation at this point,
and both young ladies began to count their
stitches aloud, to avoid the appearance of
the foolish embarrassment that ever overtakes
a brace of gossips at being thus interrupted.</p>

<p>Sarah's work lay on her stand near the
window, where she had thrown it when the
crying child attracted her notice, and she
resumed it now. It was a dress for Jeannie.
It was a rare occurrence for the second
sister to fashion anything so pretty
and gay for her own wear.</p>

<p>"Have you taken to fancy work at last?"
asked Victoria, seeing that the unmade
skirt was stamped with a rich, heavy pattern
for embroidery.</p>

<p>"No!" Sarah did not affect her sister's
friend, and did not trouble herself to disguise
her feelings towards her.</p>

<p>Lucy explained: "She is making it for
Jeannie. She does everything for that
child."</p>

<p>"You are very sisterly and kind, I am
sure," Victoria continued, patronizingly.
"You must quite despise Lucy and myself
for thinking of and doing so much for ourselves,
while you are such a pattern of self-denial."</p>

<p>A blaze shot up in Sarah's eye; then she
said, coldly: "I am not self-denying. Have
I ever found fault with you or Lucy for
doing as you like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear. But you take no interest
in what we enjoy. I dare say, now,
you would think it a dull business to work
day after day for three or four weeks together,
crocheting a shawl which may go
out of fashion before one has a chance to
sport it at a watering-place."</p>

<p>"I certainly should!" The curl of the
thin upper lip would have answered for
her had she not spoken.</p>

<p>"And you hate the very sight of shellwork
and cone-frames, and Grecian painting,
and all such vanities?"</p>

<p>"If I must speak the truth, I do&mdash;most
heartily."</p>

<p>Victoria was not easily turned from her
purpose.</p>

<p>"Come, Sarah! Tell us what you would
have us, poor trifling, silly things, do to
kill the time."</p>

<p>"If you must be a murderer, do it in your
own way. I have nothing to say in the
matter."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that time never hangs
upon your hands&mdash;that you are never ennuyee&mdash;blasee?"</p>

<p>"Speak English, and I will answer you."</p>

<p>"I want to know," said the persevering
tormentor, "if the hum-drum books upstairs,
your paint-box and your easel are
such good company that you are contented
and happy always when you are with them&mdash;if
you never get cross with yourself and
everybody else, and wonder what you were
put into the world for, and why the world
itself was made, and wish that you could
sleep until doomsday. Do you ever feel
like this?"</p>

<p>Sarah lifted her eyes with a wondering,
incredulous stare at the flippant inquisitor.</p>

<p>"I have felt thus, but I did not suppose
that you had."</p>

<p>"Oh, I have a 'blue' turn now and then,
but the disease is always more dangerous
with girls of your sort&mdash;the reading, thinking,
strong-minded kind. And the older
you grow, the worse you will get. I haven't
as much book knowledge as you have,
but I know more of the world we live in.
Take my advice and settle down to woman's
right sphere. Drive away the vapors
with beaux and fancy-work now. By-and-by
a husband and an establishment will
give you something else to think about."</p>

<p>Sarah would have replied, but Lucy
broke in with a laugh, light and sweet.</p>

<p>"You two are always at cross-questions!
Why can't you be satisfied to let one another
alone? Sarah and I never quarrel,
Vic.. We agree to disagree. She gives me
my way, and I don't meddle with her. If
she likes the blues (they say some people
enjoy them), where's the harm of her having
them? They never come near me. If
I get stupid, I go to bed and sleep it off.
Don't you think I have done ten rows
since breakfast? What a godsend a rainy
day is, when one has a fascinating piece of
work on hand!"</p>

<p>Too proud to seem to abandon the field,
Sarah sat for half an hour longer, stitching
steadily away at the complicated tracery
upon the ground to be worked; then,
as the dimmer daylight caused the others
to draw near to the windows, she pushed
aside her table and put by her sewing.</p>

<p>"Don't let us drive you away!" said Victoria's
mock-polite tones, and Lucy added,
kindly, "We do not mean to disturb
you, Sarah, dear."</p>

<p>"You do not disturb me!" was the reply
to the latter. The other had neither glance
nor word.</p>

<p>Up another flight she mounted to a room,
much smaller than that she had left and
far plainer in its appointments. The higher
one went in Mrs. Hunt's house the less
splendid everything became. In the state
spare chamber&mdash;a story below&mdash;nothing of
comfort and luxury was wanting, from the
carved rosewood bedstead, with the regal-looking
canopy overshadowing its pillows,
down to the Bohemian and cut-glass scent
bottles upon the marble of the dressing-cabinet.
Sarah's carpet was common ingrain,
neither pretty nor new; a cottage
bedstead of painted wood; bureau and
washstand of the same material; two
chairs and a small table were all the furniture
her mother adjudged needful. To
these the girl had added, from her pittance
of pocket-money, a set of hanging bookshelves,
a portable desk, an easel and two
or three good engravings that adorned the
walls.</p>

<p>She locked the door after her, with a
kind of angry satisfaction in her face, and
going straight to the window leaned upon
the sash and looked down into the flooded
street. Her eyes were dry, but there was
a heaving in her throat, a tightening of the
muscles about the mouth that would have
made most women weep for very relief.
Sarah Hunt would have scorned the ease
purchased by such weakness. She did not
despise the sad loneliness that girt her
around, any more than the captive warrior
does his cell of iron or stone, but she held
that it would be a cowardly succumbing to
Fate to wound herself by dashing against
the grim walls, or bring out their sleeping
echoes by womanish wailings. So, presently,
her throat ached and throbbed no longer,
the rigid muscles compressed the lips
no more than was their wont, the hands
loosened their vise-like grasp of one another&mdash;the
brain was free to think.</p>

<p>The rain fell still with a solemn stateliness
that befitted the coming twilight. It
was a silent storm for one so heavy. The
faint hum of the city, the tinkle of the
car-bell, three blocks off, arose to her window
above its plashing fall upon the pavement,
and the trickle of the drops from
sash to sill. A stream of light from the
lamp-post at the corner flashed athwart
the sidewalk, glittered upon the swollen
gutter, made gold and silver blocks of the
paving stones. As if they had waited for
this signal, other lights now shone out
from the windows across the way, and
from time to time a broad, transient gleam
from opening doors told of the return of
fathers, brothers, husbands from their
day's employment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In happy homes he sees the light."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What was there in the line that should
make the watcher catch her breath in sudden
pain and lay her hand, with stifled
moan, over her heart, as she repeated it
aloud?</p>

<p>Witness with me, ye maternal Hunts,
who read this page&mdash;you, the careful and
solicitous about many things&mdash;in nothing
more ambitious than for the advancement
and success in life of your offspring&mdash;add
your testimony to mine that this girl had
all that was desirable for one of her age
and in her circumstances. A house as
handsome as her neighbors, an education
unsurpassed by any of her late school-fellows,
a "position in society;" a reasonable
share of good looks, which only required
care and cultivation on her part to become
really distingue; indulgent parents and
peaceably inclined brothers and sisters&mdash;read
the list, and solve me, if you can, the
enigma of this perturbed spirit&mdash;this hungering
and thirsting after contraband or
unattainable pleasures.</p>

<p>"Some girls will do so!" Mrs. Hunt assured
her husband when he "thought that
Sarah did not seem so happy as Lucy. He
hoped nothing ailed the child. Perhaps the
doctor had better drop in to see her. Could
she be fretting for anything, or had her
feelings been hurt?"</p>

<p>"Bless your soul, Mr. H. There's nothing
the matter with her. She always was kind
o' queer!" (Mrs. Hunt did not use her
company grammar every day.) "And she's
jest eighteen year old. That's the whole
of it! She'll come 'round in good time,
'specially if Lucy should marry off pretty
soon. When Sarah is 'Miss Hunt,' she'll
be as crazy for beaux and company and as
ready to jump at a prime offer as any of
'em. I know girls' ways!"</p>

<p>Nor am I prepared to say that Sarah, as
she quitted her look-out at the high window
at the sound of the dinner bell, could
have given a more satisfactory reason for
her discontent and want of spirits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Mrs. Hunt's china, like her grammar, was
of two sorts. When her duty to "society"
or the necessity of circumstances forced
her to be hospitable, she "did the thing"
well. At a notice of moderate length she
could get up a handsome, if not a bountiful,
entertainment, to which no man need
have been ashamed to seat his friends,
and when the occasion warranted the display
she grudged not the "other" china,
the other silver, nor the other table-linen.</p>

<p>She did, however, set her face, like a
broad flint, against the irregularity of inviting
chance visitors to partake of the
family bread and salt. Intimate as Victoria
West was with Lucy, she met only a
civil show of regretful acquiescence in her
proposal to go home as the dinner hour
approached, and Robbie or Richard Hunt
was promptly offered to escort her to her
abode upon the next block. If she remained
to luncheon, as she would do occasionally,
Lucy, in her hearing, begged her
mother to excuse them from going down,
and to send up two cups of tea and a few
sandwiches to the sitting-room. This slight
repast was served by the butler upon a
neat little tray, in a tete-a-tete service&mdash;a
Christmas gift to Lucy "from her ever-loving
Victoria," and sentimentally dedicated
to the use of the pair of adopted sisters.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sarah was not surprised to
find Victoria gone, despite the storm, when
she entered the dining-room. An immense
crumb-cloth covered the carpet; a row of
shrouded chairs, packed elbow to elbow,
stood against the further end of the apartment,
and a set of very ordinary ones were
around the table. The cloth was of whity-brown
material, and the dishes a motley
collection of halt and maimed&mdash;for all Mrs.
Hunt's vigilance could not make servants
miraculously careful. There was no propriety,
however, according to her system
of economy, in condemning a plate or cup
as past service because it had come off
second best, to the extent of a crack or
nick or an amputated handle, in an encounter
with some other member of the
crockery tribe. "While there is life there
is hope," was, in these cases, paraphrased
by her to the effect that while a utensil
would hold water it was too good to be
thrown away.</p>

<p>It was not a sumptuous repast to which
Sarah sat down after she had placed Jeannie
in her high chair and tied the great
gingham bib around her neck. On the contrary,
it came near being a scant provision
for the healthy appetites of seven people.
Before Mr. Hunt, a mild, quiet little
man, was a dish of stew, which was, in its
peculiar line, a thing&mdash;not of beauty, but
wonder.</p>

<p>Only a few days since, as I stood near
the stall of a poultry vender in market, a
lady inquired for chickens.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. Roasting size, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No. I want them for a fricassee."</p>

<p>"Ah"&mdash;with a look of shrewd intelligence.
"Then, ma'am, I take it, you don't care to
have 'em overly tender. Most ladies prefers
the old ones for fricassee. They come
cheaper and very often bile tender."</p>

<p>"Thank you," was the amused rejoinder.
"The difference in the price is no consideration
where the safety of our teeth is concerned."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt suffered not these scruples to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hinder her negotiations with knowing poultry
merchants. A cent less per pound would
be three cents saved upon the chicken, and
three cents would buy enough turnips for
dinner. It is an ignorant housekeeper who
needs to be informed that stewed chicken
"goes further" than the same fowl made
into any other savory combination. Mrs.
Hunt's stews were concocted after a recipe
of her own invention. Imprimis, one
chicken, weight varying from two and a
half to three pounds; salt pork, a quarter
of a pound; gravy abundant; dumplings innumerable.
It was all "stew," and if Jeannie's
share was but a bare drumstick,
swimming in gravy and buried in boiled
dough, there was the chicken flavor
through the portion.</p>

<p>For classic antecedent the reader is referred
to the fable of the rose-scented clay.</p>

<p>To leave the principal dish, which justice
to Mrs. Hunt's genius would not permit me
to pass with briefer mention, there were,
besides, potatoes, served whole (mashed
ones required butter and cream), turnips
and bread, and Mrs. Hunt presided over a
shallow platter of pork and beans. What
was left of that dish would be warmed
over to piece out breakfast next morning.
The children behaved well, and the most
minute by-law of table etiquette was observed
with a strictness that imparted an
air of ceremonious restraint to the meal.
If Mrs. Hunt's young people were not in
time finished ladies and gentlemen, it was
not her fault, nor was it for the lack of
drilling.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you; not as I do," were her
orders in these matters. Since Lucy had
completed her education, the mother added,
"Look at your sister; she is never awkward."
This was true. Lucy was born the
fine lady. Refinement of manner and grace
of movement, an instinctive avoidance of
whatever looked common or underbred
were a part of her nature. Only the usage
of years had accustomed her to her mother's
somewhat "fussy" ways.</p>

<p>Had she met her in company as Mrs.
Anybody else, she would have yielded her
the right of way with a feeling of amazement
and amiable pity that one who meant
so well should so often overdo the thing
she aimed to accomplish easily and gracefully.
Following out her excellent system
of training, the worthy dame demanded as
diligent and alert watching from her butler
as if she were having a dinner party.
The eggless rice pudding was brought on
with a state that was absolutely ludicrous;
but the family were used to the unsubstantial
show and took it as a matter of course.</p>

<p>After the meal was over Mrs. Hunt withdrew
to the kitchen for a short conference
with the cook and a sharp glance through
the closets. It was impossible that the abstraction
of six slices of bread from the
baking of the preceding day, three thick
pieces of cheese and more than half of the
cold meat she had decided would, in the
form of hash, supply the other piece of the
breakfast at which the beans were to assist,
should escape her notice.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt was reading the evening paper
by the droplight in the sitting-room, Lucy
was busy with her shawl, and Sarah told a
simple tale in a low voice to Jeannie as she
leaned upon her lap, when the wife and
mother entered, with something like a
bluster. All present looked up, and each
one remarked the cloud upon her brow.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, mother?" said Mr.
Hunt, in a tone not free from alarm.</p>

<p>"I am worried! That's the whole of it. I
am downright vexed with you, Sarah, and
surprised, too! What upon earth possessed
you, child, to take that beggar into my
kitchen to-day? After all I have told you
and tried to learn you about these shameful
impostors! I declare I was beat out
when I heard it. And to throw away provisions
and clothes upon such a brat!"</p>

<p>Lucy opened her great eyes at her sister,
and Mr. Hunt looked perplexedly towards
his favorite, for at heart he was partial to
his second child.</p>

<p>"I took the poor creature to the fire,
mother, because she was wet and cold; I
fed her because she was hungry; I gave
her some old, warm clothes of mine because
hers were thin and soaked with
rain."</p>

<p>"Poor little girl!" murmured Jeannie
compassionately.</p>

<p>Sarah's hand closed instantly over the
little fingers. The simple-hearted babe understood
and sympathized with her motive
and act better than did her wiser elders.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no doubt she told a pitiful
story, and shed enough tears to wet her
through, if the rain had not done it already.
If you listen to what these
wretches say, and undertake to relieve
their wants, you will soon have not a dress
to your back nor a house over your head.
Why didn't you send her to some society
for the relief of the poor?"</p>

<p>"I did not know where to find one,
ma'am."</p>

<p>This plain truth, respectfully uttered,
confounded Mrs. Hunt for a second.</p>

<p>"Mrs. James is one of the managers in a
benevolent association," she said, recovering
herself. "You had ought to have
given your beggar her address."</p>

<p>"Even if I had known that fact, mother,
the girl would have been obliged to walk
half a mile in the storm to find this one
manager. What do you suppose Mrs.
James would have done for her that was
not in my power to perform?"</p>

<p>"She would have asked the child whereabouts
she lived, and to-morrow she would
have gone to hunt her up. If she found
all as she had been told, which is not likely&mdash;these
creatures don't give a right direction
once in ten times&mdash;why, she would
have brought the case before the board at
their next meeting, and they would help
them, if neither of her parents was a
drinking character."</p>

<p>"God help the poor!" ejaculated Sarah,
energetically. "God help the poor, if this
is man's style of relieving his starving
brother! Mother, do you think that hunger
pinches any the less when the famished
being is told that next week or next month
may bring him one good meal? Will the
promise of a bushel of coal or a blanket,
to be given ten days hence, warm the
limbs that are freezing to-night? Is present
help for present need, then always unsafe,
imprudent, insane?"</p>

<p>"That all sounds very fine, my dear."
Mrs. Hunt grew cool as her daughter
waxed warm. "But when you have seen as
much of the world as I have you will understand
how necessary it is to be careful
about believing all that we hear. Another
thing you must not forget, and that is that
we are not able to give freely, no matter
how much disposed we may be to do so.
It's pretty hard for a generous person to
say 'No,' but it can't be helped. People in
our circumstances must learn this lesson."
Mrs. Hunt sighed at thought of the curb
put upon her benevolent desires by bitter
necessity. "And, after all, very few&mdash;you've
no idea how few&mdash;of these pretended
sufferers are really in want."</p>

<p>This preluded a recital of sundry barefaced
impositions and successful swindles
practiced upon herself and acquaintances,
to which Mr. Hunt subjoined certain of
his personal experiences, all tending to establish
the principle that in a vast majority
of cases of seeming destitution the supplicant
was an accomplished rogue and the
giver of alms the victim of his own soft
heart and a villain's wiles. Jeannie drank
in every syllable, until her ideal beggar
quite equalled the ogre who would have
made a light supper off of Hop-o'-my-Thumb
and brothers.</p>

<p>"You gave this match-girl no money, I
hope?" said Mrs. Hunt, at length.</p>

<p>"I did not, madam. I had none to give
her." Impelled by her straightforward
sense of honesty that would not allow her
to receive commendation for prudence she
had not shown, she said, bravely: "But I
lent her my umbrella upon her promise to
return it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt dropped her hands in her lap,
and stared in speechless dismay at her
daughter. Even her husband felt it his
duty to express his disapprobation.</p>

<p>"That was very unwise, my daughter.
You will never see it again."</p>

<p>"I think differently, father."</p>

<p>"You are too easily imposed upon, Sarah.
There is not the least probability that your
property will be returned. Was it a good
umbrella?"</p>

<p>"It was the one I always use."</p>

<p>"Black silk, the best make, with a carved
ivory handle&mdash;cost six dollars a month
ago!" gasped Mrs. Hunt. "I never heard
of such a piece of shameful imprudence in
all my born days. And I shouldn't wonder
if you never once thought to ask her where
she lived, that you might send a police
officer after it, if the little thief didn't bring
it back to you?"</p>

<p>"I did think of it." Sarah paused, then
forced out the confession she foresaw
would subject her to the charge of yet
more ridiculous folly. "I did think of it,
but concluded to throw the girl upon her
honor, not to suggest the theft to her by
insinuating a doubt of her integrity."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt was annoyed with and sorry
for the culprit, yet he could not help
smiling at this high-flown generosity of
confidence. "You are certainly the most
unsophisticated girl of your age I ever met
with, my daughter. I shall not mind the
loss of the umbrella if it prove to be the
means of giving you a lesson in human
nature. In this world, dear, it will not do
to wear your heart upon your sleeve.
Never believe a pretty story until you have
had the opportunity to ascertain for yourself
whether it is true or false." And with
these titbits of wordly wisdom, the cashier
picked up his paper.</p>

<p>"Six dollars! I declare I don't know
what to say to you, Sarah!" persisted the
ruffled mother. "You cannot expect me
to buy you another umbrella this season.
You must give up your walks in damp
weather after this. I can't say that I'm
very sorry for that, though. I never did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
fancy your traipsing off two or three miles,
rain or shine, like a sewing girl."</p>

<p>"Very well, madam!"</p>

<p>But, steadied by pride as was her voice,
her heart sank at the possibility of resigning
the exercise upon which she
deemed that so much of her health, physical
and mental, depended. These long,
solitary walks were one of the un-American
habits that earned for Sarah Hunt
the reputation of eccentricity. They were
usually taken immediately after breakfast,
and few in the neighborhood who were
abroad or happened to look out at that
hour, were not familiar with the straight,
proud figure, habited in its walking dress
of gray and black, stout boots, and gray
hat with black plume. It was a uniform
selected by herself, and which her mother
permitted her to assume, because it
"looked genteel," and became the wearer.
Especially did she enjoy these tramps
when the threatening storm, in its early
stages, kept others of her class and sex
at home. The untamed spirit found a
fierce pleasure in wrestling with the wind;
the hail that ushered in the snow-storm,
as it beat in her face, called up lustre
to the eye and warm color to the cheek.
To a soul sickening of the glare and perfume
of the artificial life to which she
was confined, the roughest and wildest
aspects of nature were a welcome change.</p>

<p>I remember laughing heartily, as I doubt
not you did also, dear reader, if you saw
it, at a cut which appeared several years
ago in the Punch department of "Harper's
Magazine." A "wee toddler," perhaps four
years old, with a most lack-a-daisical expression
upon her chubby visage, accosts
her grandmother after this fashion: "I
am tired of life, grandmamma! The world
is hollow, and my doll is stuffed with
sawdust, and if you please, ma'am, I
should like to go to a nunnery!"</p>

<p>Yet, that there are natures upon which
the feeling of emptiness and longing herein
burlesqued seizes in mere babyhood is
sadly true. And what wonder? From their
cradles, hundreds of children, in our so-called
better classes, are fed upon husks.
A superficial education, in which all that is
not showy accomplishment is so dry and
uninviting that the student has little disposition
to seek further for the rich kernel,
the strong meat of knowledge, is the preparatory
course to a premature introduction
into the world, to many the only
phase of life they are permitted to see, a
scene where all is flash and froth, empty
bubbles of prizes, chased by men and
women with empty heads, and oh, how
often empty, aching hearts! Outside principles,
outside affections, outside smiles,
and most pitiable of all, outside piety!
Penury of heart and stomach at home;
abroad a parade of reckless extravagance
and ostentatious profession of fine feeling
and liberal sentiments!</p>

<p>"Woe," cried the preacher, "to them
that make haste to be rich!" If he had
lived in our day, in what biting terms of
reprobation and contempt would he have
declaimed against the insane ambition of
those who forego the solid comforts of
judicious expenditure of a moderate income
would afford; spurn the holy quiet
of domestic joys&mdash;neglect soul with heart
culture&mdash;in their haste to seem rich, when
Providence has seen that wealth is not to
be desired for them! Out upon the disgusting,
indecent race and scramble! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
worship of the golden calf is bad enough,
but when this bestial idolatry rises to such
a pitch of fanaticism, that in thousands
of households copies in pinchbeck and
plated-ware are set up and served, the
spectacle is too monstrous in its abomination!
This it is that crowds our counting-rooms
with bankrupts and our state-prisons
with defaulters; that is fast turning
our ball-rooms and other places of
fashionable rendezvous into vile caricatures
of foreign courts, foreign manners,
and foreign vices; while the people we
ape&mdash;our chosen models and exemplars&mdash;hold
their side in inextinguishable laughter
at the grave absurdity of our laborious
imitation. It is no cause for marvel that,
in just retribution, there should be sent
a panic-earthquake, every three years, to
shake men to their senses.</p>

<p>Such was the atmosphere in which Sarah
Hunt had always lived. In the code subscribed
to by her mother, and the many
who lived and felt and panted and pushed
as she did for social distinction, nothing
was of real, absolute value except the
hard cash. Gold and silver were facts.
All things else were comparative in use
and worth. The garment which, last winter,
no lady felt dressed without, was an
obsolete horror this season. The pattern
of curtains and furniture that nearly
drove the fortunate purchaser wild with
delight, three years back, was now only
fit for the auction room. In vain might
the poor depleted husband plead for and
extol their beauties. The fiat of fashion
had gone forth, and his better half seasoned
his food with lamentations, and
moistened her pillow with tears until she
carried her point. We have intimated that
Sarah was a peculiar girl. Whence she
derived her vigorous intellect; her strong,
original turn of thought; her deep heart,
was a puzzle to those who knew her parents.
The mother was energetic, the
father sensible, but both were commonplace,
and followed, like industrious puppets,
in the wake of others. They were
pleased that Sarah brought home all the
prizes offered at school, and both considered
that she gained a right, by these
victories, to pursue her studies at home,
provided she did not obtrude her singular
views and tastes upon other people. Mrs.
Hunt sighed, frequently and loudly, in her
presence, that her genius had not been
for shell, or bead, or worsted work, instead
of for reading volumes, that did not
even decorate the show book-case in the
library.</p>

<p>"If you must have so many books, why
don't you pick out them with the tasty
bindings?" she had asked her daughter
more than once. "And I wish you would
paint some bright, lively pictures, that
would look handsome on the walls, instead
of those queer men and women and cloudy
things you have got upstairs. I'd have
'em framed right away, and be real proud
to tell who done them."</p>

<p>Sarah remained proof against such hints
and temptation, and, shrinking more and
more from the uncongenial whirl around
her, she turned her eager, restless spirit into
her secret, inner life, where, at times, it was
flattered into content by the idealities upon
which it was fed; at others, ramped and
raved, like any other chained wild thing.
The sweetest drop of pleasure she had
tasted for many a day was the thrill she
experienced when the forlorn object she
had rescued from the power of the storm
stood before her, decently and comfortably
clad. The rash confidence she had reposed
in so suspicious a stranger was the
outgoing of a heart too noble and true in
every impulse to pause, for a moment, to
speculate upon the chances of another's
good or bad faith. The great world of the
confessedly poor was an unknown field to
her&mdash;one she longed to explore. Her footsteps
loitered more often near the entrance
of some narrow, reeking street or
alley, down which she had promised her
mother not to go, than on the spacious
pave, where over-dressed women and foppish
men halted at, and hung around bewitching
shop windows. She wondered
how such throngs of breathing beings contrived
to exist in those fetid, cramped
quarters; how they lived, spoke, acted,
felt. The great tie of human brotherhood
became daily more tense, as she pondered
these things in her heart.</p>

<p>On this particular day, as she sat, silent
and thoughtful, at her needle, the
chit-chat of her companions less heeded
than the continual dropping of the rain
without, the wail of the shivering wanderer
caused a painful vibration through
every nerve. The deed was done! the experiment
was tried. She was ashamed that
an event so trivial held her eyes waking,
far into the night. At least, she said to
herself, she would not be without a lesson
of some kind; would learn whether deceit
and falsehood prevailed in the lowest, as
well as the higher ranks of society. If,
as she still strove to believe would be the
case, the child returned the borrowed
property, she would make use of her, as
the means of entering upon a new sphere
of research and action. After so complete
a refutation of her theories respecting the
utter corruption of all people, who had
not enough to eat and to wear, her mother
could not withhold her consent to her
petition that she might become a lay-missionary&mdash;a
present relief committee to
a small portion of the suffering, toiling,
ill-paid masses. She would then have a
work to do&mdash;something to call out energy
and engage feeling in healthy exercise&mdash;and
soothed by the romantic vision, she
fell asleep with a smile upon her lips.</p>

<p>The morning dawned between breaking
clouds, that soon left the sky clear and
bright. All through the day Sarah watched
for her visitor of the preceding day&mdash;watched
with nervousness she could not
wholly conceal, from morn to night, for
two, three days&mdash;for a week. Then she
looked no longer while at home; her question,
at entering the house, after a drive
or walk, ceased to be, "Has any thing
been left for me?" So palpable was her
disappointment that her father forbore to
make any allusion to her loss, and Lucy,
albeit she was somewhat obtuse to the
finer points of her sister's character, good-naturedly
interposed to change the subject
when her mother sought to improve
the incident to her daughter's edification
and future profit. Mr. Hunt was right in
supposing that the "unsophisticated girl"
had learned something. Whether she were
happier or better for the lesson thus acquired
was another thing.</p>

<p>Once again Sarah had an opportunity for
speech with her delinquent protege. Two
months later she was passing through a
by-street in a mean neighborhood, very
far up town, in her morning ramble, when
her progress was arrested, for an instant,
by two boys, who ran out of an alley
across the walk. One overtook the other
just in front of the lady, and catching
him by his ragged collar, threw him down.</p>

<p>"That's right! beat him well! I'll help!"
screeched a girl, rushing out of the court
whence they had come.</p>

<p>Grinning with delight, she flung herself
upon the prostrate form and commenced
a vigorous assault, accompanied by language
alike foul and profane.</p>

<p>Sarah recognized her instantly, and while
she paused in mingled amazement and
anger, the child looked up and saw her.
In a twinkling she relinquished her grip
of the boy's hair&mdash;jumped up and sped
back into the dirty alley, with the blind
haste of guilty fear.</p>

<p>Yes! Mr. Hunt was a wise man, who
knew the world, and trebly sage in her
generation was his spouse. If their daughter
had never acknowledged this before,
she did now, in her disgust and dismay at
this utter overthrow of her dreams of
the virtuous simplicity to be found in lowly
homes, where riches and fashions were
things unknown.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Summer had come to the country with
its bloom and its beauty, its harvests and
its holidays. In town, its fever heat drew
noisome smells from overcharged sewers,
and the black, oily paste to which the
shower that should have been refreshing
had changed the dust of crowded thoroughfares.
Cleaner pavements, in the
higher portions of the city, burned through
shoe-soles; glass radiated heat to polished
stone, and stone radiated, in its turn, to
brick, that waited until the evening to
throw off its surplus caloric in hot, suffocating
waves that made yet more oppressive
the close nights. The gay procession
of fashionable humming birds had
commenced their migrations, steamboats
and excursion craft multiplied at the
wharves, and the iron steed put forth all
his tremendous might to bear onward the
long train of self-exiled travelers.</p>

<p>The Hunts, too, must leave town; Lucy
must, at all events, have a full season,
and a brilliant one, if possible, for it was
her second summer, and much might depend
upon it. Her mother would accompany
her, of course; and equally of course
her father could not; that is, he must return
after escorting them to Saratoga, and
spend the remainder of the warm months at
home. His business would not allow him
to take an extended vacation. The boys
were easily disposed of, being boarded
every summer at the farmhouse of an
early friend of Mr. Hunt, where they
were acceptable inmates, their clothes as
well cared for as they were at home, and
their morals more diligently cultivated.
The younger girls caused that excellent
manager, their mother, more perplexity.
This was not the first time she had repented
her indiscretion in allowing Sarah
to "come out" before her elder sister had
"gone off." But "Sarah was so tall and
so womanly in her appearance that it
looked queer, and would set people to talking
if I kept her back," she was accustomed
to excuse her impolitic move to
her friends. This summer she realized, as
she had not done before, the inconvenience
of having two full-fledged young ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
upon the carpet at once. Lucy's elegant
and varied wardrobe, and the certain expenses
in prospect for her and her chaperon
at Spa, seaside, and en route, left a
balance in hand of the sum allotted for
the season's expenditure that was startling
in its meagerness. Mrs. Hunt was a
capital financier, a peerless economist, but
the exigency taxed her resources to the
utmost.</p>

<p>One morning she arose with a lightened
heart and a smoother brow. "I've settled
it!" she exclaimed to her husband, shaking
him from his matutinal doze.</p>

<p>The "Eureka!" of the Syracusan mathematician
was not more lofty in its exultation.
Forthwith she unfolded to him her
scheme. She was a native of New Jersey,
"the Jarseys" she had heard it called in
her father's house&mdash;had probably thus denominated
the gallant little state herself
in her girlhood. In and around the pretty,
quiet village of Shrewsbury there were still
resident scores of her relatives whose very
names she had sedulously forgotten. One
alone she could not, in conscience or in
nature, dismiss to such oblivion. This
was her elder and only sister, long married
to a respectable and worthy farmer, and
living within a mile of "the old place,"
where both sisters had drawn the first
breath of life. Twice since Mrs. Hunt had
lived in the city had this kind friend been
summoned on account of the dangerous
illness of the former, and her presence
and nursing had restored peace, order, and
health to the household. The earlier of
these occasions was that of the second
child's birth, and in the softened mood of
her convalescence Mrs. Hunt had bestowed
upon the babe her sister's name&mdash;Sarah
Benson&mdash;a homely appellative she had ofttimes
regretted since. At distant and irregular
intervals, one, two, three years,
Mr. or Mrs. Benson visited their connections
in "York;" but the intercourse grew
more difficult and broken as time rolled
on and the distance widened between the
plain country folk and their rising relations.
Then, again, death had been busy
in the farmhouse; coffin after coffin, of
varying lengths, but all short, was lifted
over the threshold and laid away in the
village graveyard, until but one was left
to the parents of the seven little ones
that had been given to them, and to that
one nature had denied the gifts of speech
and hearing. Grief and the infirmities of
approaching old age disinclined the worthy
pair to stir from home, and their ambitious
sister was too busy in building up a
"set" of her own, and paving the way
for her daughters' distinction, to hide her
light for ever so short a period in so obscure
a corner as her former home.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, however, could not forget
her nurseling. Every few months there
arrived some simple token of affectionate
remembrance to "the child" she had not
seen since she wore short frocks and pinafores.
The reception of a basket of fruit,
thus despatched, was the suggestive power
to Mrs. Hunt's present plan. She had
made up her mind, so she informed her
husband straightway, to write that very
day&mdash;yes! that very forenoon, to "Sister
Benson," and inquire whether she would
board Sarah and Jeannie for a couple of
months.</p>

<p>"I don't s'pose she will let me pay board
for them, but she will be pleased to have
'em as long as they like to stay. It's never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been exactly convenient for me to let any
of the children go there for so many years,
and it's so fur off. But dear me! sometimes
I feel real bad about seeing so little
of my only sister!"&mdash;a heavy sigh. "And
there'll be the expenses of two saved, out
and out, for they won't need a great variety
of clothes in that out-of-the-way
place."</p>

<p>"But how will the girls, Sarah and Jeannie,
fancy being sent off so?" inquired Mr.
Hunt.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that, it is late in the day for
my children to dispute what I say shall
be done; and Sarah's jest that odd that
she'll like this notion twenty times better
than going to Newport or Saratoga. I
know her! As to Jeannie, she is satisfied
to be with her sister anywhere. She is getting
thin, too; she looks real peaked, and
there's nothing in creation so good for
ailing children as the salt-water bath.
They have first-rate still-water bathing not
a quarter of a mile from sister's. It's
jest the thing, I tell you! The wonder
is it never came into my head before."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt had his sigh now. "Somehow
or other he was always down in the mouth
when the family broke up for the summer,"
his wife frequently complained, and
his lack of sympathy now excited her just
ire.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, Mr. H.! anybody would
think that I was the poorest wife in the
world to you to see and hear you whenever
I talk to you of my plans and household
affairs. You look as if you was about
to be hanged, instead of feeling obliged
to me for turning, and twisting, and contriving,
and studying, day and night, how
to save your money, and spend what we
must lay out to the best advantage. I
can tell you what&mdash;there's few women
would make your income go as far as I
do."</p>

<p>"I know that, my dear. The question
is"&mdash;Mr. Hunt paused, cleared his throat
and strained his nerves for a mighty effort,
an unprecedented exercise of moral
courage&mdash;"the question is, Betsy, whether
our income is stretched in the right direction!"
Mistaking the stare of petrified
incredulity he received for fixed attention,
the infatuated man went on: "This doubt
is always forced upon me when we separate
in July, some to go to one place, some
to another, a broken, wandering family
for months together. I am growing old,
and I love to have my children about me;
I begin to feel the want of a home.
There is Johnson, in the &mdash;&mdash; Bank, gets
five hundred less per annum than I do;
yet, after living quietly here a few years,
he bought himself a snug cottage up the
river, and has his family there in their
own house, everything handsome and
comfortable about them. I have been in
the harness for a long while; I expect to
die in it. I don't mind work&mdash;hard work!
but it seems to me sometimes that we
would all be better satisfied if we had
more to show, or to hold, for our money;
if there were less of this straining after
appearances, this constant study to make
both ends meet."</p>

<p>"And it has come to this!" Mrs. Hunt
sank into a chair and began to cry. "This
is my thanks for slaving and toiling for
better than twenty years to get you and
your children a stand in the world! It
isn't for myself that I care. I can work
my fingers to the bone, and live upon a
crust! I can scrape and save five dollars
or so a month! I can bury myself in the
country! But your children! those dear,
sweet girls, that have had the best education
money can buy, and that to-day visit
such people as the Murrays, and Sandersons,
and Hoopers, and Baylors, and meet
the Castors and Crinnalls at parties&mdash;millionaires,
all of 'em, the cream of the
upper crust! I don't deny that I have
been ambitious for them, and I did hope that
you had something of the same spirit;
and now to think of your complaining,
and moping, and groaning over the money
you say I've been and wasted; oh! oh! oh!"</p>

<p>"You misunderstand me, my dear; I
merely questioned whether we were acting
wisely in making so much display upon
so little substance. We are not millionaires,
whatever may be said of the girls'
visiting acquaintances, and I tremble
sometimes to think how all this false
show may end."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt's borrowed courage had not
evaporated entirely.</p>

<p>"That's distrusting Providence, Mr. H.!
It's downright sinful, and what I shouldn't
have looked for from you. I can tell you
how it will end. If both of us live ten
years longer, you will see your daughters
riding in their own carriages, and leaders
of the tong, and your sons among the first
gentlemen of the city. If this does not
turn out true, you needn't ever trust my
word again. I've set my head upon getting
Lucy off my hands this summer, and well
off; and mark my words, Mr. H., it shall
be done."</p>

<p>One part of her mother's prophecy was
fulfilled in Sarah's manner of receiving the
proposition so nearly affecting her comfort
during the summer. Lucy wondered at
the cheerful alacrity with which she consented
to be "hidden away in that horrid
bore of a farmhouse," and Jeannie cried as
her elder sister "supposed that they would
eat in Aunt Sarah's kitchen, along with the
servant men."</p>

<p>"Lucy, be quiet!" interposed her mother.
"Your aunt is not a common poor person.
Mr. Benson is a man of independent
means, quite rich for the country. They
live very nicely, and I have no doubt but
that your sisters will be happy there."</p>

<p>Sarah had drawn Jeannie to her, and
was telling her of the rides and walks
they would take together, the ducks and
chickens they would feed, and the merry
plunges in the salt water that were to be
daily luxuries. Ere the recital was concluded,
the child was impatient for the
hour of departure, and indignant when she
heard that Aunt Sarah must be heard
from before they could venture to present
themselves, bag and baggage, at her door.
There was nothing feigned in Sarah's satisfaction;
her preparations were made
with far more pleasure than if she were to
accompany Lucy. The seclusion that would
have been slow death to the latter was
full of charms for the book-loving sister.
Aunt Sarah would be kind; the novel
phases of human nature she would meet
would amuse and interest her; and, besides
these, there was Jeannie to love and pet,
and river, field, and grove for studies and
society. She panted for the country and
liberty from the tyrannous shackles of
city customs.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah wrote promptly and cordially,
rejecting the offered compensation, and
begging for her nieces' company as long
as they could content themselves in so retired
a place. Simple-minded as she was,
she knew enough to be sure that the
belles and beaux of the neighborhood
would be very unsuitable mates for her
expected visitors. If her own girls had
lived, she would have asked nothing higher
for them in this world than to have
them grow up respected, beloved, and
happy, among the acquaintances and
friends of their parents; but "Sister Betsy's
children had been raised so differently!"
she said to her husband. "I don't
know what we will do to amuse them."</p>

<p>"They will find amusement&mdash;never fear,"
was the farmer's response. "Let city folks
alone for seeing wonders where those that
have lived among them all their lives
never found anything uncommon. They
are welcome to the pony whenever they've
a mind to ride, and Jim or I will find time
to drive them around a'most every day;
and what with riding, and boating, and
bathing, I guess they can get rid of the
time."</p>

<p>Before the day set for the coming of the
guests there appeared upon the stage an
unexpected and welcome ally to Aunt
Sarah's benevolent design of making her
nieces' sojourn agreeable. This personage
we will let the good woman herself describe.</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself to fix up
for tea, dear," she said to Sarah, the afternoon
of her arrival, as she prepared to
remove her traveling dress. "There's nobody
here besides husband, and me, and
Charley, except husband's nephew, Philip
Benson, from the South. He comes North
'most every summer, and never goes back
without paying us a visit. He's been here
three days now. But he is just as easy as
an old shoe, and sociable as can be, so
you won't mind him."</p>

<p>"Uncle Benson has relatives at the South,
then?" said Sarah, seeing herself called
upon to say something.</p>

<p>"One brother&mdash;James. He went to Georgy
when he wasn't more than sixteen
years old, and has lived there ever since.
He married a rich wife, I believe"&mdash;sinking
her voice&mdash;"and has made money fast,
I've heard. Philip never says a word
about their wealth, but his father owns a
great plantation, for husband asked him
how many acres they worked. Then the
children&mdash;there are four of them&mdash;have had
fine educations, and always spend money
freely. Philip is not the sort to boast of
anything that belongs to him or his. He
is a good-hearted boy. He was here the
August my last daughter&mdash;my Betsy&mdash;died,
and I shall never forget how kind and
tender he was then. I can't look at him
without thinking how my Alick would
have been just his age if he had lived.
One was born on the fourth and the other
the fifth of the same April."</p>

<p>Keeping up a decent show of interest in
these family details, Sarah divested Jeannie
of her sacque and dress, and substituted
a cool blue gingham and a muslin
apron. Then, as the child was wild to run
out of doors, she suffered her to go, charging
her not to pass the boundary of the
yard fence. Aunt Sarah was dressed in
a second mourning delaine, with a very
plain cap, and while the heat obliged Sarah
to lay aside the thick and dusty garment
she had worn all day, she had too much
tact to offer a strong contrast in her own
attire to her unpretending surroundings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
A neat sprigged lawn, modest and inexpensive,
was not out of place among the
old-fashioned furniture of her chamber,
nor in the "best room," to which they
presently descended.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah ushered her into the apartment
with some stiffness of ceremony. In
truth, she was not herself there often, or
long enough to feel quite at ease, her
property though it was. Alleging the necessity
of "seeing to the tea," she bade
her niece "make herself at home," threw
open a blind that she "might see the
river," and left her.</p>

<p>First, Sarah looked around the room. It
was large and square, and had four windows,
two in front and two in the rear.
The floor was covered by a well-saved
carpet, of a pattern so antique that it
was in itself a curiosity; heavy tables of
a mahogany dark with age; upright chairs,
with slippery leathern seats; a ponderous
sofa, covered with haircloth; small mirrors,
with twisted frames, between the
windows; two black profiles, of life-size,
over the mantel, and in the fireplace a jar
of asparagus boughs, were appointments
that might have repelled the looker-on, but
for the scrupulous, shining cleanliness of
every article. It was a scene so strange
to Sarah that she could not but smile as
she withdrew her eyes and turned to the
landscape commanded by her window.</p>

<p>The sight changed the gleam of good-humored
amusement to one of more heartfelt
pleasure. Beyond the grassy walks
and flower-borders of the garden behind
the house lay green meadows, sloping
down to the river, broad and smooth at
this point, so placid now that it mirrored
every rope and seam of the sails resting
quietly upon its surface, and the white
cottages along the banks, while the banks
themselves, with their tufts and crowns
of foliage, drooping willows and lofty elms,
found a faithful yet a beautified counterpart
in the stream. The reflected blush of
the crimson west upon its bosom was
shot with flickers of golden light, and
faded in the distance into the blue-gray
twilight. The air seemed to grow more
deliciously cool as the gazer thought of
the hot, pent-up city, and the beds of
thyme and lavender added their evening
incense.</p>

<p>The hum of cheerful voices joined pleasantly
with the soothing influences of the
hour, and, changing her position slightly,
Sarah beheld the speakers. Upon a turfy
mound, at the foot of an apple tree, sat
Jeannie beside a gentleman, whose hands
she watched with pleased interest, as did
also a boy of fifteen or thereabouts, who
knelt on the grass before them. Sarah
divined at once that this was her aunt's
deaf and dumb son. The gentleman was
apparently interpreting to Jeannie all that
passed between himself and the lad, and
her gleeful laugh showed it to be a lively
dialogue. Could this be Mr. Benson's
nephew, the beardless youth Sarah had
pictured him to herself from Aunt Sarah's
description? He could not have been less
than six-and-twenty, had dark hair and
a close curling beard, an intelligent, handsome
face, and notwithstanding his loose
summer sack and lounging attitude, one
discerned plainly traces of uncommon grace
and strength in his form.</p>

<p>"What is he, I wonder? A gallant, professional
beau, who will entangle me in
my speech, and be an inevitable appendage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in the excursions? I flattered myself I
would be safe from all such drawbacks,"
thought Sarah, in genuine vexation, as she
obeyed her aunt's summons to tea.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Benson read as much in
her countenance, for, beyond a few polite,
very unremarkable observations, addressed
to her when his hosts made it necessary
for him to do so, he paid her no visible
attention during the whole of the evening.
The next day he set off, the minute breakfast
was over, with his gun and game-bag,
and was gone until sunset.</p>

<p>Sarah sat at her chamber window as he
came up to the back door; and, screened
by the vine trained over the sash, she
watched him as he tossed his game-bag to
Charley and shook hands with Jeannie,
who ran up to him with the familiarity of
an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"What luck?" questioned his uncle.</p>

<p>"Nothing to boast of, sir; yet enough to
repay me for my tramp. I have been
down to the shore."</p>

<p>"Philip Benson! Well, you beat everything!
I suppose you have walked as much
as ten miles in all!" exclaimed Aunt Sarah,
with a sort of reproachful admiration.</p>

<p>"I dare say, madam, and am none the
worse for it to-night. I am getting used
to your sand, uncle; it used to tire me, I
confess."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the kitchen, probably
to perform the ablutions needful after
his day's walk and work, for it was several
minutes before he returned. Charley
had carried the game-bag to the mound
under the tree, and was exhibiting its contents&mdash;mostly
snipe and red-winged black
birds&mdash;to his little cousin.</p>

<p>"It is refreshing to see something in
the shape of man that is neither an effeminate
dandy nor a business machine,"
soliloquized Sarah. "Ten miles on foot! I
would like to set that task for certain of
our Broadway exquisites!"</p>

<p>"She isn't a bit like a city girl!" Aunt
Sarah was saying, as she followed Philip
into the outer air.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that she is likely to
be a nice companion for you, madam. I
thought, from her appearance, that you
would suit each other," was the reply, certainly
respectful enough, but whose lurking
accent of dry indifference sent the
blood to Sarah's face.</p>

<p>Hastily withdrawing from the open window,
and beyond the reach of the voices
that discussed her merits, she waited to
recover her equanimity before going downstairs.
In vain she chided herself for her
sudden heat. Mortified she was, and even
more ashamed of herself than angry with
the cool young man who had pronounced
her to be a fitting associate for her excellent
but unpolished aunt. While his
every look and intonation bespoke the
educated gentleman, a being as different in
mental as in physical muscle from the
fops who formed her sister's train, had
he weighed her against the refined woman
of his own class and clime, and adjudged
her this place? At heart she felt the injustice,
and, stimulated by the sting, arose
the resolve that he should learn and confess
his error. Not tamely or willingly
would she accept an ignoble station at the
hands of one whom she inwardly recognized
as capable of a true valuation of
what she esteemed worthy.</p>

<p>She looked haughty, not humbled, when
she took her seat opposite her critic at
the tea-table. "A nice companion," she
was saying over to herself. The very
phrase, borrowed, as it was, from Aunt
Sarah's vocabulary, seemed to her seasoned
with contempt. She kept down fire and
scorn, however, when Mr. Benson accosted
her with the tritest of remarks upon the
probable heat of the day in town as contrasted
with the invigorating breeze, with
its faint, delicious sea flavor, that rustled
the grapevines and fluttered the white curtains
at the dining-room door and windows.
Her answer was not exactly gracious,
but it advanced the one tempting
step beyond a mere reply.</p>

<p>Thus was the ice broken, and for the
rest of the meal, Aunt Sarah and "Uncle
Nathan"&mdash;as he requested his nieces to
style him&mdash;had respite from the duty of
active entertainment, so far as conversation
went. To Sarah's surprise, Mr. Benson
talked to her almost as he would have
done to another man. He spoke of notable
persons, places, and books&mdash;things of which
she had heard and read&mdash;without affectation
of reserve or a shade of pretension;
and to her rejoinders&mdash;brief and constrained
for awhile&mdash;then, as she forgot
herself in her subject, pertinent, earnest,
salient, he gave more than courteous heed.
It was the unaffected interest of an inquirer;
the entire attention of one who felt
that he received more than he gave.</p>

<p>They parted for the night with a bow
and a smile that was with each a mute
acknowledgment of pleasure derived from
the companionship of the other; and if
neither looked forward to the meeting of
the morrow as a renewal of congenial
intercourse, both carried to their rest the
effects of an agreeable surprise in the
events of the evening.</p>



<hr class="chap" />


<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>A week had passed since the arrival of
the city nieces at the farmhouse. An
early tea, one of Aunt Sarah's generous
and appetizing repasts, was over; and
through the garden, out at the gate that
terminated the middle walk, and across
the strip of meadow-land, danced Charley
and Jeannie, followed at a more sedate
pace by Philip Benson and Sarah. Seven
days' rustication had wrought a marked
change in the town-bred girl. There was
a lighter bound in her step, and in her
cheek a clear, pink glow, while her eyes
looked softly, yet brightly, from out the
shadow of her gypsy hat, a look of half
surprise, half confidence in her companion's
face.</p>

<p>"One week ago," he was saying, "how
firmly I made up my mind that you and
I could never be anything but strangers
to each other! How I disliked you for
coming down here to interfere with my liberty
and leisure!"</p>

<p>"But even then you thought that I
would prove a 'nice companion for Aunt
Sarah'&mdash;perceived my suitableness to her
society," was the demure reply.</p>

<p>"Who told you that I said so?"</p>

<p>"Not Aunt Sarah herself, although she
considered it honest praise. I overheard
it accidentally from my window, and I can
assure you properly appreciated the compliment,
which, by the way, was more in
the tone than the words."</p>

<p>"And you were thereby piqued to a different
style of behavior. Bravo! did ever
another seed so worthless bring forth so
rich a harvest? I am glad I said it! Here
is the boat."</p>

<p>It was a pretty little affair&mdash;Charley's
property and care, and he was already in
his seat at the bow, oar in hand. Philip
helped Sarah in, placed Jeannie beside her,
and stationing himself upon the middle
bench took up a second pair of oars. A
noiseless dip of the four, and the craft
glided out into the stream, then up against
the tide, the water rippling into a foamy
wake on either side of the sharp bow.
A row was now the regular sequel to the
day's enjoyments, and to Jeannie, at least,
the climax of its pleasures.</p>

<p>"Pull that way, please, Mr. Benson!" she
cried. "There! right through that beautiful
red water!"</p>

<p>A skilful sweep brought them to the
spot designated, but the crimson deserted
the wave as they neared it, and left dull
gray in its stead.</p>

<p>"It is too bad!" complained the child,
pointing back to the track of their boat,
quivering amidst the fickle radiance she
had thought to reach by this change of
course. "It is behind us and before us&mdash;everywhere
but where we are!"</p>

<p>"Is there a moral in that?" questioned
Philip, smiling at Sarah.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so."</p>

<p>A fortnight before, how assured would
have been her reply! How gloomy her
recognition of the analogy! Changed as
was her mood, a shade fell over her countenance.
Was it of apprehension, and did
Philip thus interpret it?</p>

<p>"I could not love life and this fair
world as I do, if I conceded this to be
universally true," he said. "That there
comes, sometimes, a glory to the present,
besides which the hues of past and future
fade and are forgotten, I must and will
believe. Such, it seems to me, must be the
rapture of reciprocal and acknowledged
affection; the joy of reunion after long
separation from the beloved one; the bliss
of reconciliation after estrangement. Have
you ever thought how much happier we
would be if we were to live only in the
Now we have, and never strain our eyes
with searching for, the lights and shades
of what may be before us, or with 'mournful
looking' after what is gone?"</p>

<p>"Yet is this possible?" asked Sarah,
earnestly. "Does not the very constitution
of our natures forbid it? To me that
would be a miserably tame, dead-level
existence over which Hope sheds no enchanting
illusions; like this river, as we
saw it three days ago, cold and sombre as
the rain-clouds that hung above it. Oh,
no! give me anything but the chill, neutral
tint of such a life as thousands are content
to lead&mdash;people who expect nothing,
fear nothing&mdash;I had almost said, feel nothing!"</p>

<p>"That is because every principle of your
being is at war with common-places. Tell
me frankly, Miss Sarah, did you ever meet
another woman who had as much character
as yourself?"</p>

<p>"I do not know that I understand the
full bearing of your question." She leaned
on the side of the boat, her hand playing
in the water, her lips working in an irresolute
timidity that was oddly at variance
with their habitual firmness.</p>

<p>"I am aware," she began slowly and
gravely, "that I express myself too strongly
at times; that I am more abrupt in
language and action than most other girls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
I have always been told so; but it is
natural to me. My character has many
rough and sharp edges that need softening
and rounding"&mdash;</p>

<p>"In order to render you one of the pretty
automatons, the well-draped, thoroughly-oiled
pieces of human clockwork that decorates
men's homes&mdash;falsely so called&mdash;in
these days of gloss and humbug!" interrupted
Philip with energy. "I am sick to
death of the dollish 'sweet creatures' every
boarding-school turns out by the score. I
understand all the wires that work the
dear puppets&mdash;flatter myself that I can put
them through their paces (excuse the
slang!) in as short a time as any other
man of my age in the country. The delightful
divinities! A little music, and
a little less French; a skimming of the
arts and sciences; and it is a rare thing
to meet one who can tell an art from a
science ten days after she has graduated&mdash;a
stock of pet phrases&mdash;all hyperbolical,
consequently unmeaning&mdash;a glib utterance
of the same; a steady devotion to balls,
beau-catching, gossip, and fancy-work;
voila the modern fine lady&mdash;the stuff we
are expected to make wives of! Wives!
save the mark! I never think of the possibility
of being thus ensnared without an
involuntary repetition of a portion of the
Litany&mdash;'From all such, etc., etc.!'"</p>

<p>He plied his oars with renewed activity
for a moment, then suspended them to continue,
in a softer tone: "And this is the
representative woman of your Utopia, Miss
Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Did I intimate, much less assert, such
a heresy?" responded she, laughing. "But
there is a golden mean somewhere&mdash;a union
of gentleness and energy; of domestic and
literary taste; of independence and submission.
I have seen such in my day
dreams. She is my ideal."</p>

<p>"Which you will one day embody. No
reproachful looks! This is the sincerity
of a friend. I have promised never to
flatter you again, and do not violate the
pledge in speaking thus. From my boyhood,
I have made human nature my
study, and it would be hard to convince
me that I err in this case."</p>

<p>"You do! indeed you do!" exclaimed
Sarah, with a look of real pain. "I lack
the first characteristic of the portrait I
have drawn. I am not gentle! I never
was. I fear that I never will be!"</p>

<p>"Let us hear a competent witness on
that head. Jeannie!" to the child, who
was busy spelling on her fingers to Charley;
his nods and smiles to her, from the
far end of the boat, being more intelligible
to her than were her attempts to signal
her meaning to him. "Jeannie!" repeated
Philip, as he caught her eye. "Come, and
whisper in my ear which of your sisters
you love the best. Maybe I won't tell
tales out of school to the one you care
least for."</p>

<p>"I don't care who knows!" said the
saucy, but affectionate child. "Sis' Lucy is
the prettiest, and she never scolds me
either; but she doesn't make my clothes,
and tell me nice stories, and help me with
my lessons, and all that, you know. She
isn't my dear, best sister!" And, springing
up suddenly, she threw her arms around
Sarah's neck, with a kiss that answered
the question with emphasis.</p>

<p>Sarah's lip trembled. The share of affection
she had hitherto dared to claim as
her own had barely sufficed to keep her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
heart from starving outright. She had
often dreamed of fulness of love as a stay
and comfort, as solace and nutriment in
a world whose wrong side was ever turned
to her. Now there dawned upon her the
sweetness and beauty of a new revelation,
the bliss of loving and being beloved. Over
life floated a warm, purple tinge, like the
sunset light upon the river. For the first
time within the reach of her memory her
heart rested!</p>

<p>In the smile whose overflowing gave a
tender loveliness to her features, Philip
saw the effect he had wished and anticipated,
and, motioning to Charley to let
the boat drift with the current, he picked
up the guitar, that by Sarah's request was
always taken along in these excursions.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The dew is on the blossom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the young moon on the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the twilight hour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hour for you and me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The time when memory lingers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Across life's dreary track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the past floats up before us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the lost comes stealing back."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a love song, inimitable in its
purity and tenderness, with just the touch
of sadness that insured its passage to the
heart. Sarah's smile was softer, but it
was a smile still, as the melody arose on the
quiet air. When the ballad was concluded,
she only said, "Another, please!"</p>

<p>Philip sang more than well. Without extraordinary
power, his voice had a rich
and flexible quality of tone and a delicacy
of expression that never failed to fascinate.
To the rapt and listening girl it
seemed as if time could bring no more
delicious fate than thus to glide on ever
upon this empurpled, enchanted stream,
the summer heavens above her, and, thrilling
ear and soul, the witching lullaby that
rocked her spirit to dreams of the youth
she had never had, the love for which she
had longed with all the wild intensity,
the fervent yearning, her deep heart could
feel.</p>

<p>Still they floated on with the receding
tide, its low washing against the sides of
their boat filling up the pauses of the
music. The burning red and gold of the
sky cooled into the mellower tints of
twilight, and the pale curve of the young
moon shone with increasing lustre. Jeannie
fell asleep, her head upon her sister's
lap; the dumb boy sat motionless as stone,
his dark eyes fixed on the moon; there
seemed some spell upon the little party.
Boat after boat passed them, almost noiselessly,
for far into the clear evening went
the tones of the singer's voice, and the
dullest hearer could not withhold the
tribute of admiring silence until beyond its
reach.</p>

<p>And Sarah, happy in the strange, restful
languor that locked her senses to all except
the blessed present, dreamed on, the
music but a part of her ideal world, this
new and beautiful life. Into it stole presently
a theme of sadness, a strain of
grief, a heart-cry, that, ere she was aware,
wrung her own heart-strings with anguish.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"The long, long weary day<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>If ever a pierced and utterly hopeless
soul poured forth its plaint in musical
measure, it was in the wondrously simple
and unspeakably plaintive air to which
these words are set. There breathes in it
a spirit wail so mournfully sincere that one
recognizes its sob in the very chords of
the accompaniment. The mere murmur of
the melody, were no words uttered, tells
the story of grieving desolation.</p>

<p>Sarah did not move or speak, yet upon
her enchanted ground a cloud had fallen.
She saw the high casement and its tearful
gazer into the night, a night not of music,
and moonlight, and love, but chill, and
wet, and dreary. Rain dripped from eaves
and trees; stone steps and pavements
caught a ghastly gleam from street lamps;
save that sorrowful watcher, there was
no living creature abroad or awake. She
grew cold and sick with looking into those
despairing eyes; the gloom, the loneliness,
the woe of that vigil became her own, and
her heart sank swooning beneath the
burden.</p>

<p>As he ceased the song, Philip looked up
for some comment or request. To his surprise,
she only clasped her hands in a
gesture that might have been either relief
from or abandonment to woe, and bowed
her head upon them. Puzzled, yet flattered
by her emotion, he refrained from interrupting
her; and, resuming his oars,
lent the impetus of their stroke to that
of the tide. Nothing was said until the
keel grated upon the shelly beach opposite
the farmhouse. Then, as Philip
stooped to lift the unconscious Jeannie, he
imagined that he discerned the gleam of
the sinking moon upon Sarah's dripping
eyelashes.</p>

<p>The fancy pursued him after he had
gone up to his room. Seated at his window,
looking out upon the now starlit sky,
he smoked more than one cigar before
his musing fit was ended. It was not the
love-reverie of a smitten boy. He believed
that he had passed that stage of sentimentalism
ten years before. That Southerner
of the male gender who has not been
consumed by the fires and risen as good
as new from the ashes of half a dozen
never-dying passions before he is eighteen,
who has not offered the heart and hand,
which as often as otherwise constitute his
chiefest earthly possessions, to some elect
fair one by the time he is one-and-twenty,
is voted "slow" invulnerable. If these
susceptible sons of a fervid clime did not
take to love-making as naturally as does
a duckling to the pond by the time the
eggshell is fairly off its head, they would
certainly be initiated while in the callow
state by the rules and customs of society.
Courtship is at first a pastime, then an
art, then when the earnestness of a real
attachment takes hold of their impassioned
natures, it is the one all-absorbing,
eager pursuit of existence, until rewarded
by the acquisition of its object or thwarted
by the decided refusal of the hard-hearted
Dulcinea.</p>

<p>This state of things, this code of Cupid,
every Southern girl understands, and
shapes her conduct accordingly. Sportively,
yet warily, she plays around the hook,
and he is a very fortunate angler who
does not in the moment of fancied success
discover that she has carried off the bait
as a trophy upon which to feed her vanity,
and left him to be the laughing-stock of
the curious spectators of this double game.
She is imperturbable to meaning equivoques,
receives pretty speeches and tender glances
at their current value, and not until the
suit becomes close and ardent, the attachment
palpable to every one else, and is
confessed in so many words, does she
allow herself to be persuaded that her
adorer is "in earnest," and really desires
to awaken a sympathetic emotion in her
bosom.</p>

<p>Philip Benson was no wanton trifler with
woman's feelings. On the contrary, he had
gained the reputation in his circle of an
invincible, indifferent looker-on of the
pseudo and real combats, in Love's name,
that were continually transpiring around
him. Chivalrous in tone, gallant in action,
as he was, the girls feared while they
liked and admired him. They called him
critical, fastidious, cold; and mockingly
wondered why he persisted in going into
company that, judging the future by the
past, was so unlikely to furnish him with
the consort he must be seeking. In reality,
he was what he had avowed himself to
Sarah&mdash;a student of human nature; an
amateur in this species of social research&mdash;than
which no other so frequently results
in the complete deception of the inquirer.
Certainly no other is so apt to find its
culmination of devotion in a cold-blooded
dissection of motive, morals, and sentiment;
an unprincipled, reckless application
of trial and test to the hearts and lives
of its victims and final infidelity in all
human good, except what is concentrated
in the inspector's individual, personal self.
Grown dainty amid the abundant supply
of ordinary material, he comes at length
to disdain common "subjects." Still less
would he touch one already loathsome in
the popular estimation, through excess of
known and actual crime. But a character
fresh and noble from the Creator's hand;
a soul that dares to think and feel according
to its innate sense of right; an intellect
unhackneyed, not vitiated by worldly
policy or the dogmas of the schools; a
heart, tender and delicate&mdash;yet passionate
in love or abhorrence; what an opportunity
is here presented for the scalpel, the detective
acid, the crucible, the microscope! It
is not in fallible mortality to resist the
temptation, and even professors of this ennobling
pursuit, whose motto is, "The
proper study of mankind is Man," are, as
they allow with shame and confusion of
face, themselves mortal. Of all the dignified
humbugs of the solemn farce of life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
deliver me from that creature self-styled
"a student and judge of character!"</p>

<p>In Sarah Hunt, Philip discovered, to his
surprise, a rare "specimen;" a volume, each
leaf of which revealed new matter of interest.
The attentions he had considered
himself bound to pay her, in order to avoid
wounding their kind hosts, were soon rendered
from a widely different motive. It
did not occur to him that he was transcending
the limits of merely friendly courtesy,
as prescribed by the etiquette of the
region in which he was now a sojourner.
He was by no means deficient in appreciation
of his personal gifts; rated his powers
of pleasing quite as highly as did his
warmest admirers, although he had the
common sense and tact to conceal this;
but he would have repelled, as an aspersion
upon his honor, the charge that he was
endeavoring to win this young girl's affections,
his heart being as yet untouched.</p>

<p>"Was it then altogether whole?" he
asked himself to-night, with a coolness
that should have been an immediate reply
to the suggestion.</p>

<p>Side by side, he set two mental portraits,
and strove deliberately, impartially, to
discern any traces of resemblance between
the two. The future Mrs. Benson was a
personage that engrossed much of his
thoughts, and by long practice in the
portrayal of her lineaments, he had brought
his fancy sketch very nearly to perfection.
A tall, Juno-like figure, with raven
locks, and large, melting eyes, unfathomable
as clear; features of classic mould;
an elastic, yet stately form; a disposition
in which amiability tempered natural impetuosity,
and generous impulse gave direction
to gentle word and deed; a mind
profoundly imbued with the love of learning,
and in cultivation, if not strength,
equal to his own; discretion, penetration,
and docility combined in such proportions
as should render her her husband's safest
counsellor, yet willing follower; and controlling
and toning the harmonious whole,
a devotion to himself only second in degree,
not inferior in quality, to worship
of her Creator. This was the ideal for
whose embodiment our reasonable, modest
C&#339;lebs was patiently waiting. Answer, oh
ye expectant, incipient Griseldas! who,
from your beauteous ranks, will step into
the prepared niche, and make the goddess
a reality?</p>

<p>And how appeared the rival picture in
comparison?</p>

<p>"No, no!" he ejaculated, tossing the
remnant of his third cigar into the garden.
"I must seek further for the 'golden
mean.' Intellect and heart are here, undoubtedly.
I must have beauty and grace
as well. Yet," he continued, relentingly,
"there are times when she would be quite
handsome if she dressed better. It is a
pity her love for the beautiful does not
enter into her choice of wearing apparel!"</p>

<p>In ten minutes more he was asleep, and
dreamed that he stood at the altar with
his long sought ideal, when, as the last
binding words were spoken, she changed
to Sarah Hunt, arrayed in a light blue
lawn of last year's fashion, that made her
look as sallow as a lemon, and, to his
taste, as little to be desired for "human
nature's daily food."</p>

<p>Poor Sarah! The visionary robe was a
faithful reflection upon the dreamer's
mental retina of a certain organdie which
had formed a part of Lucy's wardrobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the previous summer, and having become
antiquated in six months' time, was altogether
inadmissible in the belle's outfit of
this season.</p>

<p>"Yet it cost an awful sum when it was
new!" reasoned Mrs. Hunt, "and will make
you a very useful dress while you are with
your Aunt Sarah. It's too good to cut up
for Jeannie!"</p>

<p>"But the color, mother?" objected the
unwilling recipient.</p>

<p>"Pooh! who will notice that? Besides, if
you had a good complexion, you could wear
blue as well as anybody."</p>

<p>Sarah's stock of thin dresses was not
plentiful, and, recalling this observation,
she coupled it with the fact that she was
growing rosy, and dared to equip herself
in the azure garment, with what effect she
did not dream and Mr. Philip Benson did!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>On a pleasant, although rather cloudy
forenoon in July, our young pleasure-seekers
carried into execution a long-talked-of
expedition to the Deal Beach, distant
about ten miles from Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>By Aunt Sarah's arrangement, Charley
and Jeannie occupied the back seat of the
light wagon, and Sarah was to sit by
Philip in front, that she "might see the
country." Having accomplished this apparently
artless manoeuvre, the good woman
handed up to them a portly basket of
luncheon, and two or three additional
shawls, in case of rain or change of
weather, and bade the gay party "good-bye"
with a satisfied glow in heart and
face. To her guileless apprehension there
was no question how affairs were progressing
between her niece and her nephew-in-law;
and in sundry conferences on the
subject between "husband" and herself,
it had been agreed that a matrimonial alliance
would be the best thing that could
happen to either of the supposed lovers.
In her simple, pious soul, the dear old
lady already blessed the Providence that
had accomplished the meeting and intercourse
under her roof, while she wondered
at "the strange things that come
about in this world."</p>

<p>Philip had been aware of her innocent
attempts to facilitate his suit for several
days past, and Sarah's blush, as she hesitated
before accepting the proffered seat
by the driver, showed that this move was
so transparent as to convey the alarm to
her also. For a full half mile Philip did
not speak, except a word now and then
to the pair of stout grays, who were Uncle
Nathan's greatest earthly boast. He appeared
thoughtful, perhaps perturbed&mdash;so
Sarah's single stolen glance at him showed&mdash;and
in the eyes that looked straight onward
to the horizon, there was a hardness
she had never seen there before. She was
surprised, therefore, when he broke the
silence by an unimportant observation, uttered
in his usual friendly tone, and for
the remainder of the ride was gay and
kind, with a show of light-heartedness that
was not surpassed by the merry children
behind them.</p>

<p>There was hardly enough variety in the
unpicturesque country bordering their
route to give the shadow of reasonableness
to Aunt Sarah's pretext in selecting her
namesake's seat, and, despite her escort's
considerate attentions, Sarah had an uncomfortable
ride; while her manner evinced
more of the haughty reserve of their introduction
than she had shown at any subsequent
stage of their acquaintance. The
grays traveled well, and a little after noon
they were detached from the carriage, and
tied in the grove of scrub-oaks skirting the
beach.</p>

<p>While Philip was busied with them, the
others continued their course down to the
shore; the children, hand-in-hand, skipping
over the sand-hills, and stopping to pick
up stones; Sarah strolling slowly after
them. She had seen the ocean surf before,
but never aught like this, with its huge
swells of water, a mile in length, gathering
blackness and height on their landward
career; as they struck the invisible
barriers that commanded, "Thus far and
no farther!" breaking in white fury, with
the leap of a baffled fiend, and a roar like
thunder, against their resistless opponent,
then recoiling, sullenly, to gather new
force for another, and as useless an attack.
The beach was wide and uneven, of
sand, whose whiteness would have glared
intolerably had the day been sunny, drifted
into hillocks and undulating ridges, like
the waves of the sea. Here and there the
hardy heather found a foothold amid the
otherwise blank sterility, the green patches
adding to, rather than lessening the wild,
desolate aspect of the tract. Fragments of
timber were strewn in all directions, and
Sarah's quick eye perceived that it was
not formless, chance driftwood. There
were hewn beams and shapely spars, and
planks in which great iron bolts were still
fast. When Philip overtook her, she was
standing by an immense piece of solid
wood, lying far beyond the reach of the
highest summer tides. One end was buried
in the sand; the other, bleached by sun
and wind, and seamed with cracks, was
curved like the extremity of a bow. Her
late embarrassment or hauteur was forgotten
in the direct earnestness of her appealing
look.</p>

<p>"Am I mistaken?" she said, in a low,
awed tone. "Is not this the keel of a
ship?"</p>

<p>"It is. There have been many wrecked
on this coast."</p>

<p>"Here!" She glanced from the fierce, bellowing
breakers to the melancholy testimonials
of their destructive might. "I
have never heard that this was esteemed
a dangerous point."</p>

<p>"You can form an imperfect idea of
what this beach is in winter," remarked
Philip, signing to her to seat herself upon
the sand and throwing himself down beside
her. "I was here once, late in the
autumn, and saw a vessel go to pieces,
scarcely a stone's throw from where we
are now sitting. The sea was high, the
wind blowing a perfect gale, and this
schooner, having lost one of her most important
sails, was at the mercy of the elements.
She was cast upon the shore, and
her crew, watching their opportunity,
sprang overboard as the waves receded
and reached firm ground in safety. Then
came a monster billow, and lifting the vessel
farther upon the sand, left her careened
towards the land. It was pitiful to see the
poor thing! So like life were her shudders
and groans as the cruel surf beat against
her, that my heart fairly ached. The spray
at every dash rose nearly as high as her
mast-head, and a cataract of water swept
over her deck. Piece by piece she broke
up, and we could only stand and look on,
while the scattered portions were thrown
to our feet. I shall never forget the sight.
It taught me the truth of man's impotence
and nature's strength as I had never read
it before."</p>

<p>"But there were no lives lost! You were
spared the spectacle of that most terrible
scene in the tragedy of shipwreck?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But the light of many a life has
been quenched in that raging caldron. A
young man, a resident of Shrewsbury, with
whom I hunted last year, described to me
a catalogue of horrors which he had beheld
here, that has visited me in dreams often
since. An emigrant ship was cast away
on this coast in midwinter. High above the
roar of the wind and the booming surf was
heard the cry of the doomed wretches, perishing
within hail of the crowd of fellow-beings
who had collected at news of the
catastrophe. The cold was intense; mast
and sail and rope were coated with ice,
and the benumbed, freezing wretches were
exposed every instant to the torrents of
brine that swept over them like sleet. The
agony was horrible beyond description, but
it was soon over. Before the vessel parted,
the accent of mortal woe was hushed. Not
a man survived to tell the tale."</p>

<p>For an hour they sat thus and talked.
The subject had, for Sarah, a fearful fascination,
and, led on by her absorbed attention,
Philip rehearsed to her wonders
and stories of the mysterious old ocean,
that to-day stretched before them, blanched
and angry, under the veil of summer cloud,
until to his auditor there were bitter wailings
blent with the surge's roar; arms,
strained and bare, were tossed above the
dark, serpent-like swell of water, in unavailing
supplication, and livid, dead faces
stared upon her from beneath the curling
crests of the breakers.</p>

<p>That day on the Deal Beach! How quietly
happy was its seeming! How full of
event, emotion, fate&mdash;was its reality! Charley
and Jeannie wandered up and down the
coast, filling their baskets with shells and
pebbles; chasing the retiring waves as far
as they dared, and scampering back, with
shrieks of laughter, as the succeeding billow
rolled rapidly after them; building
sand-houses, and digging wells to be filled
by salt water; exulting greatly when a
rough coralline fragment or a jelly-fish of
unusual dimensions was thrown in their
way. They all lunched together, seated
upon the heather-clumps, around Aunt Sarah's
liberal hamper.</p>

<p>"Sister," said Jeannie, when the edge of
her seaside appetite was somewhat blunted
by her repast, "I like living here better
than in New York&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p>"It is more pleasant in summer, my
dear."</p>

<p>"But I mean that I am happier here. I
wish you would write to mother and ask
her to let us live here always."</p>

<p>"But what would she do without her
baby?" asked Philip, emphasizing the last
word.</p>

<p>The little lady bridled instantly.</p>

<p>"Cousin Philip, I do wish you would never
call me a 'baby' again. I am seven
years and two weeks old. I could get
along very well without mother for awhile.
Of course, I would go over sometimes and
pay her a visit and get new dresses.
Shrewsbury is a nice place; I would like
to buy that pretty white house next to
Uncle Nathan's, and live there&mdash;sister and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Charley and I&mdash;and you&mdash;if you would promise
not to tease me ever."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Philip, with admirable
gravity, seeming not to notice Sarah's
heightened color at this proposal of co-partnership.
"You are very kind to include
me in your household arrangements, and
nothing would please me better, if I could
stay here. But you know, Jeannie, my
dear little cousin, that my home is far
away from this quarter of the world. I
have remained here too long already."
There was a touch of feeling or nervousness
in his voice. "I had a letter last
night, reminding me that I ought to have
left a week ago to join a party of friends,
whom I promised to meet in New York
and travel with them until the time for
our return to the South."</p>

<p>He did not look at Sarah, but she felt
that the explanation was intended for her&mdash;that,
whether intentionally or not, he was
preparing her for a blow to heart and
hope.</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged to leave Shrewsbury
and all my friends there to-morrow morning,
Jeannie."</p>

<p>The child's exclamation of dismay, and
Charley's quick, mute remonstrance to his
cousin, as his playfellow communicated the
news to him, gave Sarah time to rally firmness
and words.</p>

<p>"This is unexpected intelligence," she
said, calmly. "We shall miss you. Your
kindness has, directly and indirectly, been
the means of affording us much pleasure
during our visit to our good aunt. It will
seem dull when you are gone."</p>

<p>There was a flash in Philip's eye that
looked like pleasure&mdash;a mixture of relief
and surprise, as he turned to her.</p>

<p>"I am selfish enough to hope that you
will miss me for a time, at least. I shall
not then be so soon forgotten. We have
had some pleasant days and weeks together,
have we not?"</p>

<p>"I have enjoyed them, assuredly."</p>

<p>She was a little pale, Philip thought, but
that might be the effect of fatigue. Her
cheek was seldom blooming, unless when
flushed in animated speech, or by brisk exercise.
She spoke of his going with politeness,
that seemed scarce one remove from
carelessness; and, man-like, his pleasure
at the thought that their association in
the country house had not been followed
by the results Aunt Sarah wished and predicted,
gave way to a feeling of wounded
vanity and vexation, that his summer's
companion could relinquish him so easily.
While he repeated to himself his congratulations
that his friendly and gallant
attentions had not been misconstrued, had
not awakened any inconvenient because
futile "expectations," he wondered if it
were a possibility for a girl of so much
sense and feeling, such genuine appreciation
of his talents and tastes, to know him
well&mdash;even intimately&mdash;without experiencing
a warmer sentiment than mere approval
of an agreeable associate's mind and
manners, and Platonic liking for him on
these accounts.</p>

<p>With the respectful familiarity of a privileged
acquaintance, he drew her hand
within his arm as they arose at the conclusion
of the collation.</p>

<p>"We have yet two hours and more to
spend here, before we set out for home.
We can have one more walk and talk together."</p>

<p>They took but one turn on the beach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and returning to their morning's seat beside
the half-buried keel tried to talk as
they had done then. It was hard work,
even to the man of the world, the heart-free
student of human nature. Gradually
the conversation languished and died away,
and for awhile both sat silent, looking out
upon the sea. Then Philip's gaze came
back to his companion&mdash;stealthily at first,
and, as she remained unconscious of his
scrutiny, it lingered long and searchingly
upon features, form and attire.</p>

<p>There were white, tight lines about her
mouth, and a slight knitting of the brow,
that imparted a care-worn look to the
young face it pained him to see. Her hands
were clasped upon her knee, and the fingers
were bloodless where they interlaced
one another. Was she suffering? Was the
threatened parting the cause of her disquiet?
If this were so, what was his duty
as a man of honor&mdash;of common humanity?
And if he were forced to admit that he
held her happiness in his power, and to accept
the consequences that must ensue
from his idle gallantry and her mistaken
reading of the same, was the thought really
repulsive? Would it be a total sacrifice
of feeling to a sense of right? It was a
repetition, grave and careful, of the revery
of that July night two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Sarah's hat&mdash;a broad-brimmed "flat" of
brown straw&mdash;had fallen back upon her
shoulders, and the sea breeze played in her
hair, raising the short and loose strands
and giving to the whole a rough, "frowzy"
look. Her plain linen collar and undersleeves
showed her complexion and hands
to the worst possible advantage. Upon her
cheeks, this same unfriendly wind had bestowed
a coat of tan and a few freckles,
that were all the more conspicuous from
her pallor, while her fingers were as brown
as a gypsy's. Her gray poplin dress had
lost most of its original gloss, and being
one of Mrs. Hunt's bargains&mdash;"a cheap
thing, but plenty good for that outlandish
Shrewsbury"&mdash;already betrayed its cotton
warp by creases that would not be
smoothed, and an aspect of general limpness&mdash;a
prophecy of speedy, irremediable
shabbiness. Cast loosely about her shoulders
was a light shawl, green, with black
sprigs&mdash;another bargain; and beyond the
skirt of her robe appeared the toe and instep
of a thick-soled gaiter, very suitable
for a tramp through damp sand, yet anything
but becoming to the foot it protected.</p>

<p>With an impatient shake of the head, involuntary
and positive, Philip closed his
final observation. And cutting off a large
splinter from the weather-beaten timber
against which he leaned, set about trimming
it, wearing a serious, settled face,
that said his mind was fully made up.</p>

<p>What had Sarah seen all this while?</p>

<p>Heavens, over which the films of the
forenoon had thickened into dun cloud-curtains,
stretching above and enwrapping
the world; a wild, dreary expanse of troubled
waters, whose horizon line was lost
in the misty blending of sea and sky, ever
hurrying and heaving to moan out their
unrest upon the barren beach. In the distance
was a solitary sail; nearer to the
land, a large sea-bird flew heavily against
the wind. In such mateless, weary night
must her life be passed; that lone, frail
craft was not so hopelessly forlorn upon a
gloomy sea, beneath a sky that gloomed
yet more darkly&mdash;as was her heart, torn
suddenly from its moorings&mdash;anchor and
rudder and compass gone. Yet who could
syllable the mighty sorrow of the complaining
sea? And were there words in
human language that could tell the anguish
of the swelling flood beating within
her breast?</p>

<p>"Going away! To-morrow!" For a little
space this was all the lament she kept repeating
over to herself. Pregnant with woe
she knew it to be, yet it was not until she
was allowed to meditate in silence upon
the meaning of the words that she realized
what had truly come upon her. She had
thrown away all her hope of earthly happiness&mdash;risked
it as madly, lost it as surely,
as if she had tossed it&mdash;a tangible pearl&mdash;into
the yawning ocean. Her instinct assured
her that, were it otherwise, the tidings
of Philip's intended departure, his
suddenly formed resolution to leave her,
would have been conveyed to her in a far
different manner. Her keen backward
glance penetrated Aunt Sarah's simple
wiles; his obvious annoyance thereat; his
determination to save himself from suspicion;
his honorable fear lest she, too,
should imagine him loving, where he was
only civil and kind. Yes, it was all over!
The best thing she could hope to do, the
brightest prospect life had now for her,
was that her secret should remain hers
alone, until the troubled heart moaned itself
into rest which knows no waking. She
was used to concealment. All her existence,
excepting the sweet delusive dream of
the past three weeks, had been a stern
preparation for this trial. But she was already
weary and faint&mdash;fit to lie down and
die, so intense had been the throe of this
one struggle.</p>

<p>"How long is this to last? How long?"</p>

<p>The exclamation actually broke, in an inarticulate
murmur, from her lips.</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" inquired Philip.</p>

<p>"I think not. I am not sure. I did not
intend to do so."</p>

<p>"Grant me credit for my forebearance in
not obtruding my prosaic talk upon your
musings," he went on, playfully. "It was
a powerful temptation&mdash;for I remember,
constantly, that this is our last opportunity
for a genuine heart and head confabulation,
such as I shall often linger for after
I leave you&mdash;and sincerity! You have done
me good, Miss Sarah; taught me Faith,
Hope, Charity&mdash;a blessed sisterhood!"</p>

<p>"May they ever attend you!"</p>

<p>"Amen! and thank you! And what wish
shall I make in return for your beautiful
benediction?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you like. My desires are not
many or extravagant."</p>

<p>"You are wrong. You have a craving
heart and a craving mind. May both be
fed to the full, with food convenient for
them&mdash;in measures pressed down, shaken
together and running over."</p>

<p>"Of what? Husks?" was Sarah's unspoken
and bitter reply. She could not thank
him, as he had done her. She only bowed,
and, bending forward, took up a handful of
the fine white sand that formed the shore.
Slowly sifting it through her fingers, she
waited for him to speak again.</p>

<p>Was this careless equanimity real or
feigned? The judge of character, the harpist
upon heart-chords, made the next move&mdash;not
the candid, manly friend.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask a favor of you&mdash;a
bold one."</p>

<p>"Say on."</p>

<p>"By the time I am ready to retrace my
steps southward you will be again settled
in New York. Will you think me presumptuous
if I call at your father's house
to continue an acquaintance which has
been, to me, at once agreeable and profitable?"</p>

<p>The fingers were still, suddenly. A warm
glow, like sunrise, swept over cheek and
forehead. A smile, slight but sweet, quivered
upon her lips. Drowning in the depths,
she heard across the billow a hail that
spoke of hope, life, happiness.</p>

<p>"We will all be glad to see you," she
said, with affected composure.</p>

<p>"Not half so glad as I shall be to come.
Will you now, while you think of it, give
me your address?"</p>

<p>He handed her a card and a pencil. She
wrote the required direction and received
in exchange for it the now smooth bit of
wood, which had afforded occupation to
Philip for half an hour past. It was tendered
in mock ceremony, and accepted
smilingly. Upon the gray tablet was inscribed
"Philip Benson, Deal Beach, July
27th, 1856." A playful or thoughtless impulse
caused him to extend his hand for it,
after she had read it, and to add a motto,
stale as innocent in his eyes: "Pensez a
moi!"</p>

<p>"I shall preserve it as a souvenir of the
day and place," observed Sarah, slipping
it into her pocket.</p>

<p>Twilight overtook them before they
reached home, and the night was too
cloudy and damp for a promenade, such as
they often had in the garden walks and
lane, or for the customary family gathering
in the long porch. Yet Aunt Sarah was
surprised that Philip was apparently content
to spend the evening in the sitting-room,
with herself and husband by to spoil
the tete-a-tete he must be longing for.</p>

<p>Still more confounded was she, when,
after her clever strategy of coaxing Uncle
Nathan into the kitchen, that the coast
might be clear, she heard Philip's step
close behind them.</p>

<p>"I must clean my gun to-night, aunt," he
said, taking it from the corner. "I shall
not have time to do it to-morrow."</p>

<p>With the utmost nonchalance he began
the operation, whistling softly a lively air
over his work. Aunt Sarah gave her partner
a look of bewildered despair, which he
returned by a confirmatory nod, and a
smile, half comic, half regretful.</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning the nephew-guest
said affectionate farewells to his
relatives and Jeannie; a grave, gentle adieu
to Sarah, accompanied by a momentary
pressure of the hand, that may have meant
much or little, and upon the snug homestead
settled a quiet that was dreariness
itself to one of its inmates.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Meanwhile, how had the time sped to the
nominal head of the Hunt household&mdash;the
solitary, toiling father and husband? The
servants were dismissed when "the family"
left town, although Mr. Hunt continued
to sleep at home. A peripatetic
maid-of-all-work&mdash;what the English denominate
a charwoman&mdash;was engaged to
come early every morning to clear up the
only room in the establishment that was
used before the cashier went out for his
breakfast, which he procured at a restaurant
pretty far down town. The same
quiet coffee-house furnished him with dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and an early tea, after which last refreshment
he was at liberty to pass the
evening in whatever manner he liked best.
There was nothing in the city worth seeing
at this season, even if he had not lost all
taste for shows and gayety. Those of his
acquaintances who were not absent with
their wives and daughters were living like
himself, furniture in overalls, carpets covered,
apartments closed, with the exception,
perhaps, of one bedroom, and had no
place in which to receive him if he had
been in the habit of visiting, which he was
not. He was very tired, moreover, by the
time night came on, and as the heat increased
and the days grew longer, his
strength waned more and more, and his
spirits with it. Meekly and uncomplainingly
he plodded through his routine of bank
duties, so steady and so faithful that his
fellow-workers and customers had come to
regard him as a reliable fixture, a piece
of machinery, whose winding up was self-performed
and whose accuracy was infallible.</p>

<p>When, therefore, on a sultry August afternoon,
he turned to leave his desk at the
close of business hours, grew terribly pale
and dropped upon the floor in a fit of
death-like faintness, there was great consternation,
and as much wonder as if no
human clock-work had ever given out before,
under a like process of exhausting
demands.</p>

<p>Clumsily, but with the best of intentions,
they brought him to his senses, and in half
an hour or so he was sufficiently recovered
to be taken home. There was a twitching
of the lips that might have passed for a
sarcastic smile, as he heard the proposal
to convey him to his house; but he only
gave his street and number, and lay silently
back in the carriage, supported by his
friends, two of whom insisted upon seeing
him safely to his own abode.</p>

<p>"Is this the place? Why, it is all shut
up!" exclaimed one of these gentlemen as
the driver drew up before the dusty steps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt's orders were that the entrance
to her mansion should present the
most desolate air possible during her absence.
It had "an aristocratical look in the
summer time, when everybody but nobodies
was rusticating."</p>

<p>Again that singular contortion of the
mouth, and the master (?) of the forlorn-looking
habitation prepared to descend,
fumbling in his pocket for his pass-key.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, gentlemen, for your
great kindness, and will&mdash;not&mdash;trouble&mdash;you&mdash;longer."</p>

<p>In trying to raise his hand to his hat for
a bow, the ghastly hue again overspread
his face, and he staggered. Without further
parley his two aids laid hold of him,
one on each side, and supported him into
the house, up one, two flights of linen-draped
stairs, to a back bedroom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt would have let her husband
faint on the sidewalk before she would
have received company in that chamber in
its present condition; for the handsomest
articles of furniture stood covered up in
another apartment, and their place was
supplied by a plain bureau, wash-stand and
bed belonging to the boys' room, a story
higher up. The wisdom of this precaution
was manifest in the signs of neglect and
slovenliness displayed on all sides. One
could have written his name in the dust
upon the glass; there was dirt in every corner
and under each chair and table; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
wash-basin was partly full of dirty suds,
and the towels and counterpane shockingly
dingy.</p>

<p>These things were not remarked by the
intruders until they had got their charge
to bed, resisted no longer by him, for he
began to comprehend his inability to help
himself.</p>

<p>"There is no one besides ourselves on
the premises, not even a servant," one of
them said apart to his associate, after a
brief absence from the room. "If you will
stay with him until I come back I will go
for a doctor."</p>

<p>The invalid caught the last word.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Hammond, there is no need
for you to do anything more&mdash;no necessity
for calling in a physician. I am quite comfortable
now, and shall be well by morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond, who was a director in
the bank, and sincerely honored the honest
veteran now prostrated by his devoted
performance of duty, took the hot, tremulous
hand in his.</p>

<p>"I cannot allow you to peril your valuable
health, my dear sir. Unless you positively
forbid it, I shall not only call your
physician, but drop in again myself this
evening, and satisfy my mind as to
whether you require my presence through
the night."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word; but no
amount of persuasion could induce Mr.
Hunt to accept his offered watch. He
would be "uneasy, unhappy, if his young
friend sacrificed his own rest so uselessly,"
and loath as he was to leave him to
solitude and suffering, Mr. Hammond had
to yield. At his morning visit, he found
the patient more tractable. After tedious
hours of fevered wakefulness, he had endeavored
to rise, only to sink back again
upon his pillow&mdash;dizzy, sick, and now thoroughly
alarmed at the state of his system.
He did not combat his friend's proposal
to obtain a competent nurse, and to look
in on him in person as often as practicable;
still, utterly refused to allow his wife to be
written to on the subject of his indisposition.</p>

<p>"I shall be better in a day or two, probably
before she could reach me. I have
never had a spell of illness. It is not likely
that this will be anything of consequence.
I greatly prefer that she should not be
apprised of this attack."</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond was resolute on his part&mdash;the
more determined, when the physician
had paid another visit, and pronounced the
malady a low fever, that would, doubtless,
confine the sick man to his bed for several
days, if not weeks.</p>

<p>"It is not just to your wife and children,
Mr. Hunt, to keep them in ignorance of so
important a matter!" he urged. "They
will have cause to feel themselves aggrieved
by you, and ill-treated by me, if
we practice this deception upon them."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt lay quiet for some minutes.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are in the right," he said.
"Sarah would be wounded, I know. I will
send for her!" he concluded, with more
animation. "She will come as soon as she
receives the letter."</p>

<p>"Of course she will!" rejoined Mr. Hammond,
confidently; "you are not able to
write. Suffer me to be your amanuensis."
He sat down at a stand, and took out his
pen. "Where is Mrs. Hunt at present?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure. Either at Saratoga or
Newport."</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond looked surprised. "But it
is necessary, sir, that we should know
with some degree of certainty, or the letter
may miscarry. Perhaps it would be
well to write to both places."</p>

<p>"The letter! Both places!" repeated Mr.
Hunt, with perplexity. "I alluded to my
daughter Sarah, sir, my second child, who
is spending the summer with her aunt in
Shrewsbury, New Jersey. May I take the
liberty of asking you to write her a short
note, mentioning my sickness in as guarded
terms as you can use, and requesting
her to come up to the city for a few days?
She has my youngest child&mdash;a little girl&mdash;with
her. If she can be contented to remain
with her aunt, Sarah had better
leave her there. She would be an additional
burden to her sister if she were
here."</p>

<p>Whatever Mr. Hammond thought of the
marked preference shown to the daughter
above the wife, he said nothing, but proceeded
to indite the desired epistle, adding,
in a postscript, on his own account, that
he would take pleasure in meeting Miss
Hunt at the wharf, on her arrival, and for
this purpose would be at the boat each
day, until she made her appearance in
New York.</p>

<p>He went, accordingly, the next afternoon,
although very confident that she could not
have received his letter in season to take
that boat. Mr. Hunt had proved to him
and to himself the utter impossibility of her
coming, yet his eyes brightened with expectancy
as his friend entered, and faded
into sadness as he reported the ill-success
of his errand.</p>

<p>"He is evidently extremely partial to
this one of his children," thought Mr. Hammond,
as he paced the wharf on the second
evening, watching, amid noisy hack-drivers
and expressmen, for the steamer. "I
have seen the girls at parties, but do not
remember their names. One of them is
very pretty. I wonder if she is 'Sarah!'"</p>

<p>It was growing dusk as the boat touched
the pier. So dim was the light, that Mr.
Hammond was obliged to station himself
close beside the gangway, and inspect the
features of each lady passenger more narrowly
than politeness would, in other circumstances,
have warranted. They hurried
across, men and women, tall and
short, stout and slender, until there
tripped towards him the figure of a young
girl, attired in a gray dress and mantle,
and carrying a small traveling bag in her
hand. She would have passed him, had
he not stepped forward and spoken.</p>

<p>"Miss Hunt, I believe!"</p>

<p>In the uncertain twilight, he could see
that she grew very pale.</p>

<p>"How is my father?"</p>

<p>There was no preamble of civility or
diffidence; no reserve in addressing him, a
mere stranger; no trembling, preparatory
queries; but a point-blank question, in a
tone whose impatient anguish moved his
kind heart; a piercing look, that would
know the truth then and there!</p>

<p>"He is better, to-day"&mdash;and he led her
out of the press of the onward stream.
"He has not been dangerously ill. We
hope and believe that he will not be."</p>

<p>"Is that true?" Her fingers tightened
upon his arm.</p>

<p>"It is! I would not, for the world, deceive
you in such a matter."</p>

<p>"I believe you! Thank Heaven! I feared
the worst!" She covered her face with
her hands, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Hammond beckoned a hackman, close by,
and when the short-lived reaction of overwrought
feeling subsided so far as to allow
Sarah to notice surrounding objects, she
was seated in the carriage, screened from
curious or impertinent gazers, and her
escort was nowhere to be seen. Several
minutes elapsed before he again showed
himself at the window.</p>

<p>"I must trouble you for your checks,
Miss Hunt, in order to get your baggage."</p>

<p>Already ashamed of her emotion, she
obeyed his demand without speaking.</p>

<p>"You have given me but one," he said,
turning it over in his hand.</p>

<p>"That is all, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed! You are a model traveler! I
thought no young lady, in these days, ever
stirred from home without half a dozen
trunks." To himself he added, "A sensible
girl! An exception to most of her sex,
in one thing, at any rate!"</p>

<p>Sarah sat well back into her corner, as
they drove up lighted Broadway, and was
almost rudely taciturn, while her companion
related the particulars of her father's
seizure and subsequent confinement
to his room. Yet, that she listened with
intense interest, the narrator knew by her
irregular breathing and immovable attitude.
As they neared their destination,
this fixedness of attention and posture was
exchanged for an eager restlessness. She
leaned forward to look out of the window,
and when they turned into the last street,
quick as was Mr. Hammond's motion to
unfasten the door of the vehicle, her hand
was first upon the lock. It was cold as ice,
and trembled so much as to be powerless.
Gently removing it, he undid the catch,
and assisted her to alight.</p>

<p>The hired nurse answered their ring, and
while Sarah brushed past her, and flew up
the stairway, Mr. Hammond detained the
woman to make inquiries and issue directions.</p>

<p>"It is all very dreary-like, sir," she complained.
"Everything is packed away and
locked up. There's no getting at a lump
of sugar without a hunt for the key, and
all he's seemed to care for this blessed
day, was that his daughter should be made
comfortable. He sent me out this afternoon
to buy biscuits, and sardines, and
peaches for her tea, and told me where I'd
find silver and china. It is not at all the
thing for him to be worrying at such
a rate. He'll be worse for it to-morrow,
and so I've told him, Mr. Hammond."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, Mrs. Kerr. His daughter's
coming will cheer him and quiet him, too,
I doubt not. I will not go up now. Please
present my regards to Mr. Hunt, and say
that I will call to-morrow."</p>

<p>He purposely deferred his visit until the
afternoon, supposing that Miss Hunt might
object to his early and unceremonious appearance
in the realms now under her
control; nor when he went did he ascend
at once to the sick-chamber, as was his
custom before the transfer of its superintendence.
Sending up his name by the
nurse, he awaited a formal invitation,
among the shrouded sofas and chairs of
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"You'll please to walk up, sir!" was the
message he received; and the woman subjoined,
confidentially, "Things is brighter
to-day, sir."</p>

<p>They certainly were. With wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
little noise and confusion, Sarah, assisted
by the nurse, had wrought an utter change
in the desolate apartment. With the exception
of the bureau, which had been
drawn out of sight into the adjoining
dressing-room, and the bedstead, the common,
defaced furniture had disappeared,
and its place was supplied by more comfortable
and elegant articles. The windows
were shaded, without giving an aspect
of gloom to the chamber; the bed-coverings
were clean and fresh; and the
sick man, supported by larger and plumper
pillows than those among which he had
tossed for many a weary night, greeted his
visitor with a cordial smile and outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your kind care of my
daughter last evening, sir. Sarah, my dear,
this is my friend, Mr. Hammond, to whose
goodness I am so much indebted."</p>

<p>"The debt is mine no less," was the
frank reply, as she shook hands with her
new acquaintance. "We can never thank
you sufficiently, Mr. Hammond, for all
you have done for us, in taking care of
him."</p>

<p>"A genuine woman! a dutiful, affectionate
daughter!" was now Hammond's comment,
as he disclaimed all right to her
gratitude. "None of your sentimental, affected
absurdities, with nothing in either
head or heart!"</p>

<p>This impression was confirmed by daily
observation; for politeness first, then inclination,
induced him to continue his
"professional" calls, as Sarah styled them.
He seemed to divide with her the responsibility
of her position. Its duties were
onerous; but for this she did not care. She
was strong and active, and love made labor
light&mdash;even welcome to her. A competent
cook was inducted into office below stairs,
and household matters went forward with
system and despatch. The eye of the mistress,
pro tem., was over all; her hand
ever ready to lift her share of the load,
yet her attendance at her father's bedside
appeared unremitting. His disease,
without being violent, was distressing and
wearing, destroying sleep and appetite,
and preying constantly upon the nerves.
To soothe these, Sarah read and talked
cheerfully, and often, at his request, sang
old-time ballads and childish lullabys to
court diversion and slumber.</p>

<p>Occasionally Lewis Hammond paused
without the door until the strain was concluded,
drinking in the notes with more
pleasure than he was wont to feel in listening
to the bravuras and startling, astonishing
cadenzas that were warbled in
his ears by the amateur cantatrices of the
"best circles;" then, when the sounds from
within ceased, he delayed his entrance
some moments longer, lest the songstress
should suspect his eavesdropping. He
ceased to speculate upon the reasons of
Mrs. Hunt's protracted absence at a time
when no true-hearted wife could, from
choice, remain away from her rightful
post. When, at the expiration of a fortnight
from the day of the attack, the
physician declared his patient feebly, but
surely convalescent, his young friend had
decided, to his entire satisfaction, that
things were best as they were. Mr. Hunt
had made a most judicious selection from
the female portion of his family, and what
need of more nurses when this one was so
efficient and willing? He caught himself
hoping that the fussy dame he had met in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
society would not abridge her summer's
recreation on account of an ailing husband.
He had designed going to Saratoga himself,
for ten days or two weeks; but he
was very well. It was difficult to get away
from business, and this affair of Mr.
Hunt's enlisted his sympathies so deeply,
that he could not resolve upon leaving
him. If he had never before enjoyed the
bliss that flows from a disinterested action,
he tasted it now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt was not kept in total ignorance
of what was transpiring at home.
Sarah had written, cautiously and hopefully,
of her father's sickness and her recall;
repeating Mr. Hunt's wish that his
consort should not hurry back through
mistaken solicitude for his health and
comfort; and they were taken at their
word. A week elapsed before an answer
arrived&mdash;a lengthy missive, that had cost
the writer more pains and time than the
preparation for her annual "crush" generally
did. She was an indifferent penman,
and sadly out of practice; but there
was much to be said, and "Lucy, of course,
circumstanced as she was, could not spare
time to be her scribe."</p>

<p>This significant phrase quickened Sarah's
inborn curiosity; but there was nothing
for the next three pages that fed or
quieted it. They were filled with minute
directions about housewifery&mdash;economical
details, that would have served as capital
illustrations of "Poor Richard's" maxims;
injunctions, warnings, and receipts sufficient
in quantity to last a young, frugally-disposed
housekeeper for the remainder of
her natural existence. It was a trial to
this exemplary wife and mother, she confessed,
to absent herself so long from her
home duties; but circumstances had compelled
her to stay at Saratoga. Of their
nature, Sarah had already been informed
in her sister's last letter.</p>

<p>"Which I cannot have received, then"&mdash;Sarah
interrupted herself to say, as she
read to her father: "I have not heard from
Lucy in four weeks. I have thought hard
of her for not writing."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But," concluded Mrs. Hunt, "matters
looks well just now, and I know your
father will aggree, when he heers all about
our season's work, that our labor and
Money has been a good investment. Take
care of the keys yourself, Sarah. Be
pruedent, keep a sharp Lookout on the
cook, and don't negleck your poor father.</p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"Your Affectionate mother,</p> <p style="text-align: right;">"E. Hunt."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"E. H."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lucy had slipped a note in the same envelope&mdash;a
thin, satiny sheet, hardly larger
than the little hand that had moved over
its perfumed page. Her chirography was
very running, very light, very ladylike,
and, we need not say, very italical.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mamma tells me, Sarah dear, that she
has given you a hint of how matters are
progressing between your humble servant
and our particular friend, of whom I wrote
in my last. The poor, dear woman flatters
herself that it is all her work; but somebody
else may have his own opinion, and I
certainly have mine. I have had to caution
her repeatedly, to prevent her from showing
her delight too plainly to my 'Goldfinch,'
as Vic. and I have dubbed him.
Don't be in a hurry with your congratulations,
ma chere. 'There's many a slip
'twixt the cup and the lip;' and although
the season is so near over, I may yet see
some one whom I like better than His
Highness. Vic. has a beau, too&mdash;a rich
widower, less fascinating than my devoted;
but a very agreeable man, without encumbrance,
and very much smitten. So
we pair off nicely in our rides and promenades,
and, entre nous, are quite the talk.
You are a good little thing to nurse papa
so sweetly&mdash;a great deal better than I am.
I told my knight of this proof of your
excellence the other day, and he said it
was only what might have been expected
from my sister! Don't you feel flattered?
Poor fellow! Love is blind, you know.</p>

<p>"Love to papa. I am sorry he has been
so unwell. I do not imagine that I shall
have time to write again before we leave
this paradise. We will telegraph you when
to expect us. Perhaps I may have an
escort home&mdash;some one who would like to
have a private conference with my respected
father. Nous verrons!</p>

<p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">"Lovingly,</p> <p style="text-align: right;">"Lucie."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hunt twisted himself uneasily in his
arm-chair as his daughter, by his desire,
reluctantly read aloud the double letter.
A shade of dissatisfaction and shame
clouded his countenance when she finished,
and he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I am glad they are still enjoying themselves,"
said Sarah, forcing a smile. "Lucy
has secured a captive too, it appears&mdash;one
whom she is likely to bring home at her
chariot wheels."</p>

<p>"In my day daughters were in the habit
of consulting their fathers before giving
decided encouragement to any admirers,
strangers especially," said Mr. Hunt, with
displeasure. "In these times there are no
parents! There is the 'old man' and 'the
Governor,' who makes the money his children
honor him by wasting, and the 'poor,
dear woman,' who plays propriety in the
belle's flirtations, and helps, or hinders,
in snaring some booby 'Goldfinch.' It is
a lying, cheating, hollow world! I have
been sick of it for twenty years!"</p>

<p>"Father! my dear father," exclaimed
Sarah, kneeling beside him, and winding
her arms about his neck. "You misjudge
your children, and their love for you!"</p>

<p>"I believe in you, child! I cannot understand
how you have contrived to grow up
so unlike your sister and your"&mdash;The
recollection of the respect his daughter
owed her mother, checked the word.</p>

<p>"You do not deal fairly with Lucy's
character, father. She has one of the kindest
hearts and most amiable dispositions in
the world. I wish I had caused you as
little anxiety as she has. Remember her
obedience and my wilfulness; her gentleness
and my obstinacy, and blush at your
verdict, Sir Judge!"</p>

<p>She seated herself upon his foot-cushion
and rested her chin upon his knee, looking
archly up in his face. She was surprised
and troubled at this degree of
acrimony in one whose habitual manner
was so placid, and his judgment so mild;
but, for his sake, she was resolute not
to show her feeling. He laid his hand
caressingly upon her shoulder, and sank
into a revery, profound, and seemingly not
pleasant.</p>

<p>Sarah took advantage of his abstraction
to remove the wrapper of a newspaper
received by the same mail that had brought
her letters. The operation was carefully
performed, so as not to invite notice, and
the envelope laid away in her work-box.
She knew well who had traced the clear,
bold superscription, and what initials composed
the mysterious cipher in one corner
of the cover; nor was this the only token
of recollection she had from this source.
The article marked in the number of the
literary journal he had selected as the
medium of correspondence, was an exquisite
little poem from an author whose
works Philip had read to her in the vine-covered
porch at Shrewsbury. Slowly,
longingly she perused it; gathering sweetness
from every word, and fancying how
his intonations would bring out beauties
she could not of herself discover. Then
she took out the wrapper again, and studied
the postmark. On the former papers
he had sent the stamp was illegible, but
this was easily deciphered&mdash;"Albany."</p>

<p>"So near! He is returning homewards!"
was the glad reflection that flooded her
face with joy.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" said her father, abruptly. "Do
you ever think of marriage?"</p>

<p>"Sir?" stammered the girl, confused beyond
measure.</p>

<p>"I mean, have you imbibed your sister's
ideas on this subject? the notions of ninety-nine
hundredths of girls in your walk
of life. Do you intend to seek a husband,
boldly and unblushingly, in all public
places? to degrade yourself by practising
the arts they understand so well to catch
an 'eligible' partner, who may repay your
insincerity and mercenary views by insult
and infidelity&mdash;at best by indifference!
Child! you do not know the risk match-making
mothers and husband-hunting
daughters run; the terrible retribution that
may be&mdash;that often is in store for such!
I had rather see you and your sister dead,
than the victims of that most hateful of
heartless shows&mdash;a fashionable marriage!
Poor Lucy! poor Lucy!"</p>

<p>"I hope you are distressing yourself without
reason, sir. Mother is not the person to
surrender her child to one whose character
and respectability are not indisputable. Nor
is Lucy sentimental. I do not fear her suffering
very acutely from any cause."</p>

<p>"I grant that. You would be more to be
pitied as an unloved or unloving wife,
than she. I tremble for you sometimes,
when I think of this chance. My daughter,
when you marry, look beyond the outside
show. Seek for moral worth and a
true heart, instead of dollars and cents!"</p>

<p>"I will! I promise!" said Sarah, her
amazement at his earnestness and choice
of topics combining to shake her voice
and constrain her smile. "But there is
time enough for that, father dear. When
the man of heart and worth sues for my
poor hand, I will refer him to you, and
abide entirely by your decision."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hammond is downstairs," said the
servant at the door. And Sarah, gathering
up her papers, escaped from the room
before he entered.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Mr. Hunt was able to resume his place in
the bank several days before his wife returned.
Uncle Nathan had brought Jeannie
home as soon as her father could leave
his room, and the boys had likewise been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
written for; so that the family reunion
was apparently near at hand.</p>

<p>Weak as he was, Mr. Hunt met his
spouse and daughter at the depot, and the
noise of their entrance in the lower hall
first apprised Sarah of their arrival. To
the bound of pleasurable excitement her
heart gave at the certainty that they had
come, succeeded a sigh at the termination
of the free, yet busy life she had led of
late&mdash;the probability that she would be
compelled to resume her old habits of feeling
and action. Driving back the selfish
regret, she ran down to welcome the travellers.</p>

<p>"How well you're looking, Sarah!" said
Mrs. Hunt, after kissing her. "I declare,
if you was to arrange your hair different,
and study dress a bit, you would come
near being right down handsome."</p>

<p>"'Handsome is as handsome does!'"
quoted Mr. Hunt, stoutly. "According to
that rule, she is a beauty."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir!" said Sarah, bowing
low. And she tried to forget, in her sister's
affectionate greeting, the chill and
heart-sickness produced by her mother's
business-like manner and compliment.</p>

<p>"Having disposed of one daughter, she
means to work the other into merchantable
shape!" was her cynical deduction
from the dubious praise bestowed upon
herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt pursued her way up the steps,
examining and remarking upon everything
she saw.</p>

<p>"Them stair-rods ain't so clean as they
had ought to be, Sarah. I'm afraid your
girls are careless, or shirks. When did you
uncover the carpet?"</p>

<p>"Some time ago, mother, while father
was sick. There were gentlemen calling
constantly, and the cover looked shabby,
I thought."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be helped, I s'pose; but the
carpet is more worn than I expected to
see it. With the heavy expenses that will
be crowding on us this fall and winter,
we can't afford to get any new things for
the house."</p>

<p>Lucy, who preceded her sister, glanced
back and laughed meaningly. And Sarah
was very glad that her father had not
overheard the observation, which confirmed
her belief that the beauty's hand was disposed
of without the form of consultation
with her natural and legal guardian.</p>

<p>Dinner was announced by the time the
traveling habiliments and dust were removed.
Sarah had spared no pains to
provide a bountiful and tasteful repast, at
the risk of incurring her mother's reproof
for her extravagant proclivities. But the
dame was in high good-humor, and the
youthful purveyor received but a single
sentence of deprecation.</p>

<p>"I hope you have not been living as high
as this all the time, Sarah!"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. Father's wants and mine
were very few. I foresaw that you would
need substantial refreshment after your
journey."</p>

<p>"You was very thoughtful. We both
have good appetites, I guess. I know that
I have."</p>

<p>"Mine will speak for itself," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"You have no idea how that girl has
enjoyed everything since she has been
away," observed Mrs. Hunt to her husband.
"There was Vic. West, who took
it into her head that she ought to look die-away
and peaking, and refuse food, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
her beau was by; but Lu., she just went
right along and behaved natural, and I'm
sure that somebody thought more of her
for it."</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt's face darkened for a moment;
but he could not find fault with his eldest
child on her first evening at home.</p>

<p>"So you have been quite a belle, Lucy,"
he said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Better than that, Mr. H.!" Mrs. Hunt
checked her triumphant announcement as
the butler re-entered the room. "I shouldn't
wonder," she resumed, rather mysteriously,
"if Lucy was disposed to settle down into
a steady, sedate matron after her holiday."</p>

<p>"Don't deceive yourself with that hope!"
laughed Lucy.</p>

<p>She was evidently pleased by these not
over-delicate allusions to her love-affairs,
and, like her mother, extremely complacent
over the result of her recent campaign.
Sarah felt that, were she in her
place, she would shrink from this open
jesting upon a sacred subject; still she
had not expected that her sister would
behave differently. Lucy's nature was gentle
without being fine; affectionate but
shallow. She would have had no difficulty
in attaching herself to any man whom her
friends recommended as "a good match,"
provided he were pleasing in exterior, and
her most devoted servitor.</p>

<p>The sisters had no opportunity of private
converse until they adjourned to the
parlor for the evening. Lucy was very
beautiful in a blue silk, whose low corsage
and short sleeves revealed her superb
shoulders and rounded arms. Her complexion
was a rich carmine, deepening or
softening with every motion&mdash;one would
have said, with every breath. Her blue
eyes fairly danced in a sort of subdued
glee, very charming and very becoming
but altogether unlike the tender, dewy
light of "Love's first young dream."</p>

<p>"How lovely you have grown, sister!"
said Sarah, earnestly. "Oh, Lucy, I don't
believe you rightly value the gift of beauty&mdash;as
I would do if it were mine!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" The dimples, that made her
smile so bewitching, broke her blushes into
rosy waves as the conscious fair one
turned her face towards the mirror. "I
am pleased to hear that I am passable
to-night. We may have visitors. A friend
of ours has expressed a great desire to
see me in my home&mdash;'in the bosom of my
family.' Ahem!"</p>

<p>She smoothed out an imaginary wrinkle
in her bodice, an excuse for tarrying longer
before the glass.</p>

<p>"He came to town with you, then?" ventured
Sarah.</p>

<p>Lucy nodded.</p>

<p>"And promised to call this evening?"</p>

<p>"Right again, my dear!"</p>

<p>She was graver now, for she had conceived
the happy notion of appropriating to
her own use a cluster of white roses and
buds she discovered in the vase on the
marble slab under the mirror. If anything
could have enhanced the elegance of her
figure and toilet, it was the coiffure she immediately
set about arranging. The flowers
were a present to Sarah from Lewis Hammond;
but she thought little of him or of
them, as Lucy laid them first on one, then
on the other side of head, to try the
effect.</p>

<p>"And you really care for him, sister?"
came forth in such a timid, anxious tone,
that Lucy burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"You dear little modest piece of romantic
simplicity! One would suppose that you
were popping the question yourself, from
your behavior. Care for him? Why
shouldn't I? I need not say 'yes' unless I
do, need I?"</p>

<p>"But you take it so coolly! A betrothal
is, to me, such a solemn thing."</p>

<p>"And to most other girls, perhaps.
(There! if I only had a hair-pin. Don't
rob yourself! thank you! Isn't that an improvement?)
As I was saying, why should
I pretend to be pensive and doleful, when I
am as merry as a lark? or lovesick, when I
have never lost a meal or an hour's sleep
from the commencement of the courtship
until now? That is not my style, Sarah.
I am very practical in my views and feelings.
Not that I don't play talking sentiment
in our genuine lovescenes, and I
really like unbounded devotion on the other
side. It is decidedly pleasant to be adored.
I was surprised to find how I enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sister! sister!" Sarah leaned her
forehead on the mantel, repelled and well-nigh
disgusted by this heartless trifling&mdash;this
avowed counterfeit&mdash;so abhorrent to
her feelings. But Lucy was as much in
earnest as she could be on such a theme.
She went on, unheeding her sister's ejaculation.</p>

<p>"You must understand, of course, that we
are not positively engaged. I gave him&mdash;Goldfinch&mdash;a
good scolding for violating the
rules of etiquette by addressing me while
I was away from home; but it was just like
him. He is as impulsive as he can live. To
punish him I refused to answer him until
after our return to New York, and his interview
with father. He would have written
to him on the spot, had I not forbidden
him. He behaved so beautifully, that I
consented to his taking charge of us to the
city, and I suppose the rest must follow in
good time. How melancholy your face is!
Are you very much afflicted at the thought
of losing me? Why, Sarah! my dear child,
are those tears in your eyes? If she isn't
crying in good earnest!"</p>

<p>And Lucy's musical laugh rolled through
the rooms in her enjoyment of the joke.
What else could it be to her, elate with her
success in achieving the chief end of woman&mdash;the
capture of a rich and handsome,
in every respect an unexceptionable lover?</p>

<p>"Hist!" she said, raising her finger. "He
has come! Your eyes are red! Run, and
make yourself presentable!"</p>

<p>The door opening from the hall into the
front parlor, swung on its hinges as Sarah
gained the comparative obscurity of the
third and rear room. A strong impulse of
interest or curiosity there arrested her
flight to enable her to get a glimpse of her
destined brother-in-law. Lucy had not
mentioned his proper name, since her earliest
letter from Newport had eulogized a
certain George Finch, a Bostonian,
wealthy, and attentive to herself. Sarah's
backward glance fell upon the visitor as he
met his queenly bride-elect directly under
the blazing chandelier.</p>

<p>It was Philip Benson!</p>

<p>Chained to the spot by weakness or horror,
the looker-on stood motionless, while
the suitor raised the lily fingers he held to
his lips, and then led Lucy to a seat. His
voice broke the spell. As the familiar cadences
smote her ear, the sharp pain that
ran through every fiber of her frame awakened
Sarah from her stupor.</p>

<p>How she gained her room she never
knew; but she had sense enough left to direct
her flight to this refuge&mdash;and, when
within, to lock the door. Then she threw
up her arms with a piteous, wailing cry,
and fell across the bed, dead for the time
to further woe.</p>

<p>Alone and painfully she struggled back
to consciousness. Sitting upright, she
stared wonderingly around her, unable to
recollect what had stricken her down. The
chamber was imperfectly lighted by the
rays of the street lamp opposite, and with
the recognition of objects within its narrow
limits there crept back to her all that had
preceded her retreat thither. For the next
hour she sat still&mdash;her head bowed upon
her knees, amid the wrecks of her dream
world.</p>

<p>Dreary and loveless as had been most of
her previous life, she had never endured
anything like this, unless one miserable
hour upon the Deal Beach, when Philip
broke the tidings of his intended departure,
were a slight foretaste of the agony, the
utter despair, that claimed her now for its
victim. Since then, she had been hopeful.
His promise of a visit, the tokens of remembrance
he had transmitted to her
every week, had kept alive memory and
expectation, and this was his coming! this
the occasion she had pictured so fondly,
painted with the brightest hues Love could
borrow from imagination! She had heard
again the voice that had haunted her
dreams, from their parting until now&mdash;heard
it in deeper, softer tones than it had
ever taken in speech with her; heart-music
which told that his seekings and
yearnings for the one and only beloved
were over. And was not her quest of years
ended likewise? Truly, there are two senses
in which every search, every combat may
be said to be closed; one when the victor
grasps his prize, or waves aloft his sword
in the moment of triumph; the other,
when, bleeding, maimed, or dying, the vanquished
sinks to the earth without power
to rise!</p>

<p>A tap at her door startled Sarah. She did
not stir until it was repeated, and her
father called her name. A stream of light
from the hall fell upon her face as she admitted
him.</p>

<p>"Daughter, what ails you?" was his exclamation.</p>

<p>"I am not very well, father."</p>

<p>"I should think not, indeed! Come in
here and lie down!" He led her to the bed,
and, lighting the gas in the chamber, came
back to her and felt her pulse.</p>

<p>She knew what was the direction of his
fears; but to correct his misapprehension
was to subject herself to further questioning.
Passively she received the pressure of
his hand upon her head, the gentle stroking
of the disordered hair; but when he stooped
to kiss her, he felt that she trembled.</p>

<p>"Dear child! I shall never forgive myself
if you have taken the fever from me!"</p>

<p>"I do not fear that, father. My head
aches, and I am very tired. I have been so
busy all day, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, and for many other days. You are,
without doubt, overworked. I hope this
may prove to be all the matter with you.
A night's rest may quite cure you."</p>

<p>"Yes sir," she answered, chokingly.
"You will excuse me to &mdash;&mdash;, downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Would you like to have your
mother come up to you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir! Please tell her there is no
need of it. I shall be better to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your sister"&mdash;and he looked more serious,
instead of smiling&mdash;"has a visitor. Her
friend is an acquaintance of yours, also, it
appears&mdash;the Mr. Benson whom you met at
your aunt's in July."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know it."</p>

<p>"I understood you to say that Lucy had
never said positively who her lover was;
but this was not the name you told me of,
as the person whom you imagined him to
be."</p>

<p>"I was misled for a time myself, sir,"
replied the poor girl, pressing her temples
between her palms.</p>

<p>"I see that I am tiring you. Forgive me!
but it is so natural to consult you in everything.
I must trouble you with some questions,
which it is important should be answered
to-night, before this gentleman and
myself have any conversation. Is Mr. Benson
a man whom you consider worthy of
trust? Your mother represents him to be
enormously wealthy&mdash;a reputation I had
concluded he possessed, from Lucy's pet
name for him. It is well that your sister
has a prospect of marrying advantageously
in this respect, for she would never be
happy in an humble sphere; but antiquated
people like myself regard other things as of
greater consequence in concluding a bargain
for a lifetime. Is your opinion of Mr.
Benson favorable as to disposition, principles,
and conduct?"</p>

<p>Sarah's head rested on the foot-board of
her couch, in weariness or pain, as she rejoined:
"I saw and heard nothing of him,
during our intercourse in the country, that
was not creditable. His uncle and aunt are
very partial to him, and speak of his character
in high terms. Their testimony ought
to have weight with you, for they have
known him from his boyhood up."</p>

<p>"It ought and does. I am relieved to hear
all this! very much pleased!" said Mr.
Hunt, enthusiastically. "I have all confidence
in Nathan Benson's judgment and
integrity. I hope his nephew is as sterling
a man. Thus far," he continued, playfully,
"I have learned but one thing to his discredit,
and that is, having seen this one of
my daughters, he could afterwards fall in
love with the other."</p>

<p>"I am not beautiful and good like Lucy,
father."</p>

<p>"Very dear and lovely in my eyes, my
child! Again forgive me for having worried
your poor head with my inquiries. I
was unwilling to decide a matter where
Lucy's happiness was involved, without
obtaining your evidence in the case. A
last good-night! and God bless you, my
dearest, best daughter!"</p>

<p>Sarah held up her face for his kiss without
attempting to speak. This burning
ordeal, the harder to endure because unexpected,
was over. She was as weak as a
child with conflicting passions when she
arose and endeavored to undress. After
stooping several times to regain breath and
strength, she was at last ready to creep
into bed, there to lie until morning broke,
sleepless and suffering.</p>

<p>Her sharpened senses could discern her
father's and mother's voices in the sitting-room,
in confidential talk&mdash;interrupted, by-and-by,
by Lucy's pure, mellow tones, apparently
conveying some message to the
former. Its import was easily surmised,
for his step was then heard in the hall and
on the stairs, until he reached the parlor
where Philip awaited him. Their conference
did not occupy more than twenty minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which time Lucy spent with her
mother&mdash;how gayly, Sarah could judge by
the laugh that, again and again, reached
her room. Mr. Hunt returned, spoke a few
sentences in his calm, grave way, and the
closing door was followed by a flutter of
silk and fall of gliding footsteps, as Lucy
went down to her now formally and fully
betrothed husband.</p>

<p>"Husband!" Yes! it was even so!
Henceforth the lives of the pair were to be
as one in interest, in aims, in affection.
Ere long, they would have no separate outward
existence in the eyes of the world.
Was his chosen love, then, in a truer and
higher sense, his other self&mdash;the being
sought so long and carefully? The pretty
fiancee would have stretched her cerulean
orbs in amazed wonder at the ridiculous
doubt, and asked, in her matter-of-fact
way, how the thing could have happened,
if it had not been intended? Philip's indignant
affirmative would have gained fervor
from his exultant consciousness of possession&mdash;so
novel and sweet. But one above
stairs, taught sagacity by the depth of her
grief, looked further into the future than
did they, and read there a different reply.</p>

<p>She heard the clang of the front door as
it shut after the young lover, and in the
still midnight, the echoes, faint and fainter,
of his retreating footsteps&mdash;the same free,
light tread she used to hearken for in porch
and hall of that riverside farm house; and
as the remembrance came over her she
turned her face to the wall, murmuring
passionately: "Oh! if I could never, never
see him again!"</p>

<p>This feeling, whether born of cowardice
or desperation, was the ruling one, when
her mother looked in upon her before
breakfast, and expressed her concern at
finding her still in bed.</p>

<p>"I am not well enough to get up,
mother," Sarah said sincerely, and Mrs.
Hunt, reading in the parched lips and
bloodshot eyes proof of the justice of the
fears her husband had expressed to her the
preceding evening, resolved that the doctor
should see her "before she was two hours
older."</p>

<p>In vain Sarah entreated that this should
not be done, and prophesied her recovery
without his assistance. For once her
parents were a unit in sentiment and action,
and the physician was summoned to
his second patient.</p>

<p>"All febrile symptoms were to some extent
contagious," he affirmed; "and while
Mr. Hunt's malady was not generally
classed with such, it was very possible that
his daughter had contracted an analogous
affection, in her constant attendance upon
him."</p>

<p>This decision Sarah dared not overthrow,
much as she wished to do so, when she saw
how it afflicted her father.</p>

<p>Undaunted by any fears of infection,
Lucy repaired to her sister's chamber when
she had despatched her breakfast.</p>

<p>"Isn't it too provoking that you should be
sick just at this time?" she began, perching
herself, school-girl fashion on the foot
of the bed. "I really admired your staying
upstairs last night; but I did not dream
that you really were not well. I promise
you that I made capital of your absence.
I told Philip (how odd it sounds, doesn't
it?) that you ran away when he rang the
bell, because you had made a fright of
yourself by crying over the prospect of my
leaving you, and that I had no doubt that
you had grieved yourself into a headache.
He wanted to know forthwith if you
objected to my marrying him; but I said
'No'; that you were charmed with the
match, and preferred him to any other admirer
I had ever had; but that we&mdash;you and
I&mdash;were so devoted to one another, that it
was acute agony to us to think of parting.
About ten o'clock he asked to see
father, and they soon settled affairs. When
I went down again, he tried a little ring
on my finger that he always wears, and it
fitted nicely. So I knew what it meant
when he put it back upon his own hand,
and that with that for a measure he could
not go wrong in getting the engagement
ring. I do hope it will be a diamond. Vic.
West declares that she would not accept
anything else. I considered for a while
whether I couldn't give him a delicate hint
on the subject, but I did not see how I
could manage it. And don't you think,
while I was studying about this, he fancied
I was sober over 'the irrevocable step I
had taken,' and became miserable and eloquent
at the suspicion! I wish I could remember
all he said! It was more in your
line than mine! But he is a good, sensible
fellow, with all his romantic notions. He
has a handsome fortune, independent of his
father, left him by his grandfather, and we
are to live in Georgia part of the year only,
and travel every summer. Mother says his
account of his prospects and so forth to
father was very satisfactory, but she has
not got at all the particulars yet. Father
is so worried about your sickness that he
cannot spare a thought for anything or
anybody else. The light from that window
hurts your eyes&mdash;doesn't it? I will let down
the shade."</p>

<p>But Sarah lay with her hand protecting
her eyes, when her sister resumed her position
and narration.</p>

<p>"We are to be married in December. He
begged hard for an earlier day, but I was
sure that I could not be ready before then.
As it is, we shall have to hurry when it
comes to the dresses, for, in order to get
the latest fashions, we must wait until the
eleventh hour. Won't I 'astonish the natives'
down South? I couldn't state this to
Philip, you know; so I referred him to
mother, who is to say, when he asks her,
that her preference would be to keep me
just as long as she possibly can. Entre
nous, my dear, our good mamma has said
truer things than this bit of sentiment&mdash;but
n'importe! These embellishments are
necessary to such transactions."</p>

<p>Miss West's friendship or curiosity could
not endure longer suspense, and the intelligence
that she was below checked the
monologue.</p>

<p>"I will run up again whenever I can,"
promised Lucy, by way of compensation
for her abrupt departure, "and keep up
your spirits by telling you all that I can
about our concerns. But Philip is to take
me to ride this afternoon. I forbade him to
come here before then, but I don't much
think he can stay away. Don't be vexed if
you don't see me again in some hours.
Vic. and I are about to settle our trousseaux.
If you believe me, we have never
been able yet to decide upon the wedding
dresses!"</p>

<p>And she vanished, warbling delicious
roulades from a duet she had engaged to
sing that evening with her betrothed. She
showed herself upstairs again, when she
was ready for her ride, and the carriage at
the door&mdash;very fair, very bright, and very
happy. She was exquisitely dressed, and
called on her sister to admire her toilet
and envy her her escort.</p>

<p>Sarah listened to the cheerful exchange
of cautions and promises between her
mother and Philip, at the door beneath her
open window, and to the rolling wheels
that bore them away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt received none of her friends
that day, being busy "getting things to
rights"; and for a like reason she absented
herself from her child's sickroom, content
with sending up Jeannie, now and then, to
inquire how she was getting on. In the
abject loneliness that oppressed her, when
the first violence of passions had spent itself,
Sarah would have been relieved in
some measure by the society of this pet
sister, the sole object upon earth, besides
her father, that had ever repaid her love
with anything like equal attachment. But
the child shrank, like most others of her
age, from the quiet dark chamber of illness,
and longed to follow her mother
through the house, in her tour of observation
and renovation. Sarah detected her
restlessness and ill-concealed dislike of the
confinement imposed upon her by compliance
with her humble petition&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, Jeannie, stay a little while with
your poor sister!" And her sensitive spirit
turned upon itself, as a final stroke of torture,
the conviction that here, also, love
and care had been wasted.</p>

<p>"Go, then!" she said, rather roughly, as
Jeannie wavered, "and you need not come
up again to-day. I know it is not pleasant
for you to be here. Tell mother I want
nothing but quiet."</p>

<p>"I have had a splendid drive!" said Lucy,
rustling her many flounces into the door at
dusk.</p>

<p>The figure upon the bed made no response
by motion or word.</p>

<p>"I do believe she is asleep!" added the
intruder, lowering her voice. "I suppose
she is tired and needs rest." And she went
out on tiptoe.</p>

<p>Sarah was awake a minute later, when
her father came in to see her. She smiled
at him, as he "hoped she was better," and
asked whether she might not get up on the
morrow. Mr. Hunt thought not. The doctor's
opinion was that perfect repose might
ward off the worse features of the disease.
She had better keep to her bed for a couple
of days yet, even should she feel well
enough to be about. He sent up her dinner
to her room with his own hands; and
when she learned this, she strove to do
some feeble justice to the viands, but without
success.</p>

<p>Philip dined with the family that day by
special appointment; and, shortly after his
arrival, Lucy again presented herself in
that small third-story bedroom.</p>

<p>"Choose! which hand will you take?" she
cried, hiding both behind her.</p>

<p>Sarah would make no selection; and,
after a little more trifling, the elder sister
brought into sight two elegant bouquets,
and laid them beside the invalid.</p>

<p>"This is Philip's present&mdash;'a fraternal remembrance,'
he told me to say. Here is
his card. Doesn't he write a lovely hand?
The other is from your admirer, Mr. Hammond.
What a sly puss you were to make
such a catch as he is, without dropping us
a hint! He is rather too sober for my notions;
but he is getting rich fast, they say.
He left those flowers at the door himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and insisted upon seeing father for a moment,
to know exactly how you were.
Cannot you hurry up somewhat, and let us
have a double wedding? I showed the bouquet
to Philip, and told him of your conquest,
and he was as much pleased at your
prospects as I was. Did you ever see such
magnificent roses? your beau paid five dollars,
at the lowest computation, for these
flowers. I congratulate you upon these
signs of liberality."</p>

<p>Sarah had heard only a portion of this
speech. Her eyes were fixed upon the card
her sister had put into her hand: "Will
Miss Sarah accept this trifling token of regard
from one who is her stanch friend,
and hopes, in time, to have a nearer claim
upon her esteem?"</p>

<p>"Very neatly turned, is it not?" said
Lucy, satisfiedly. She had read it on her
way upstairs. "What shall I say to him
from you?"</p>

<p>"Thank him, and explain that I am not
able to write a reply."</p>

<p>This meagre return of compliments assumed
a tone both grateful and sisterly as
Lucy rehearsed it to the donor of the fragrant
offering. The barest phrase of civility
came gracefully and meaningly from her
tongue. Serene in mind and countenance,
she seated herself at the piano, and, as
Philip took his stand at her side, he wondered
if the world held another couple
more entirely adapted each to the peculiar
soul-needs of the other, more perfectly
happy in the knowledge of mutual affection.
Like the generality of theorists, your
student of human nature is prone to grievous
error when he reduces his flawless
system to practice.</p>

<p>In one respect, the two certainly harmonized
well. Both loved music; both sang
finely, and their voices accorded without a
jarring note.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt read the evening papers in
Sarah's room; turning and folding them
with great circumspection, lest their rattling
might annoy her, and detract from
her enjoyment of the music. How could
he guess the infatuation that caused her to
listen greedily to sounds, under whose potent
spell feeling was writhing and brain
reeling? In every pause between the songs
there arose in her memory two lines of a
poem read long ago, when or where she
knew not:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Seek not to soothe that proud, forsaken heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With strains whose sweetness maddens as they fall!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The performers had just completed a
duet, in which each voice supported and
developed, while blending with the other,
when Lucy took up the prelude to a
simpler lay; repeating it twice over with
skilful variations, as if she were, meantime,
carrying on a colloquy with her companion,
that delayed the vocal part. This
was ended by Philip's raising alone the
burden of the plaintive German air Sarah
remembered so truly&mdash;"The long, long,
weary day."</p>

<p>As his voice, full and strong, with its
indescribable and irresistible undercurrent
of pathos&mdash;flowing out here into passionate
melancholy&mdash;swelled and floated through
the quiet house, Sarah sat upright.</p>

<p>"Father! father!" she whispered, huskily,
"I cannot bear that! Shut the doors!&mdash;all
of them, or I shall go mad!"</p>

<p>She was obeyed; Mr. Hunt hurrying down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the parlor to silence the lovers, with the
representation that Sarah was too nervous
to endure the excitement of music. For
the remainder of the evening, a profound
stillness pervaded the upper part of the
mansion&mdash;a silence that, to Sarah, throbbed
with the melody she had tried to hush; and
look where she might, she gazed into that
rainy, ghastly night&mdash;the pale, comfortless
watcher, the shadowy type of her deeper,
more blighting sorrow.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>For three days Philip Benson lingered
near his beautiful enslaver; on the fourth,
he carried a sad, yet trustful heart upon
his Southern journey. Sarah had not seen
him once since the evening of his coming.
Through Lucy, she received his adieux and
wishes for her speedy recovery. On the
next day but one she left her room, and
appeared again in the family circle&mdash;now
complete in all its parts.</p>

<p>In that short season of bodily prostration,
the work of years had been wrought upon
her inner life. Outwardly there was little
alteration save that effected by physical
weakness; but in her views of existence
and character, of affections and motives,
the doubter had become the skeptic; the
dreamer the misanthrope. To the gentle
and more womanly aspirations that had for
a season supplanted the somewhat masculine
tendencies of her mind and tastes had
succeeded a stoicism, like the frozen calm
of a winter's day, uniform as relentless.
This was the surface that locked and concealed
the lower depths she had sworn
should be forever covered. Others could
and did live without hearts. She could
thrive as well upon the husks and Sodom
apples of this world's goods as did they;
holding as Life's chief good, complete and
final subjugation of all genuine emotion,
which, at the best, was but the rough ore&mdash;fit
for nothing until purged, refined, and
polished in its glitter. She found no other
creed that suited her present desperate
mood so well as the heartless code of the
thorough worldling&mdash;the devotee to show,
and fashion, and wealth.</p>

<p>Such was her mother, whose domestic
virtues were extolled by all who knew her;
such, behind her mask of tender grace and
amiability, the sister who had won, by
these factitious attractions, the heart for
which Sarah would have perilled life, sacrificed
ease and inclination, bowed her
proud spirit to the estate of bond-servant
to his every caprice, become the willing
slave to his tyrannical behest. Yet
Philip Benson was a professed judge of
character; a man of sense, education, and
experience, and, knowing both girls as he
did, he had made his choice; set the stamp
of his approval upon the shining, rather
than the solid metal. The world, as its
young would-be disciple believed she had
at length learned, was made up of two
classes; those who floated, and those who
sank. To the latter she determined that
she would not belong.</p>

<p>These and kindred thoughts were rife in
her mind, and stirring up many a spring
of gall within her bosom, one morning as
she lay back in an armchair in the sitting-room,
listening with secret scorn to the
prattle of the pair of betrothed maidens&mdash;Lucy
and her friend. Lucy's engagement
ring was a diamond, or, rather, a modest
cluster of these precious stones, whose extreme
beauty did not strike the casual eye
with the startling effect of Victoria's more
showy gage d'amour. This apparent difference
in the value of the two was the
source of many discussions and considerable
heart-burning, disguised, of course,
and threatened in time to produce a decided
coolness between the attached wearers
of the articles under debate.</p>

<p>On this particular day, Victoria, after
some adroit skirmishing, brought out as a
"poser" the fact that, to lay the question
to rest without more ado, she had, since
their last interview, been to Tiffany's, and
had her ring valued. Lucy's face was all
aglow as her soul-sister named the price of
her treasure. She clapped her hands joyously.</p>

<p>"Isn't that the joke of the season,
mother?"&mdash;as that personage entered.
"Don't you think that Vic. was as cunning
as we were? She carried her ring to
Tiffany's yesterday, too. Wouldn't it have
been too funny if we had met there? Mine
came from there, they said, and it cost a
cool fifty dollars more than yours did,
dear!"</p>

<p>Victoria flashed hotly; but further controversy
being useless and dangerous to
her, she acquiesced with assumed carelessness
in Lucy's proposal that, since both
were suited, the rival brilliants should not
be again referred to as a disputed matter.
They accordingly turned to the safer and
endless conferences upon the trousseaux,
whose purchase must be commenced immediately.</p>

<p>Their incomplete lists were produced,
compared, and lengthened&mdash;Mrs. Hunt suggesting
and amending; Sarah surveying
the busy group with the same intense disdain
she had experienced throughout the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you! Margaret Hauton
called on me yesterday!" exclaimed
Victoria. "Did she come here, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but we were out. What did she
say?" queried Lucy, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Why, the stupid creature never alluded
to my engagement; and when I mentioned
yours, pretended not to have heard
of it before. I took care she should not go
away as ignorant on the subject as she had
come, and&mdash;I know it was wicked in me,
but she deserved it&mdash;all the time I was
praising your Goldfinch, and telling how
handsome and liberal he was, I sat looking
at my new ring, slipping it up and
down my finger, as if I were not thinking
of it, but of the giver. She could not help
seeing it, and, to save her life, she could
not keep from changing countenance."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Lucy. "Do tell me how she
is looking now?"</p>

<p>"Common enough! She had on that everlasting
lilac silk, with the embroidered
flounces, although the style is as old as the
hills&mdash;and that black lace mantle, which,
happening to be real, she never leaves off
until near Christmas. But her hat! black
and corn-color. Think of it! corn-color
against her saffron skin. When I pretend
to lead society, I hope to dress decently.
But I had my revenge for her supercilious
airs. Mr. Bond&mdash;George&mdash;called in the
afternoon to take me to ride. I told you
of the handsome span of fast horses he has
been buying. Well! we concluded to try
the Bloomingdale road, and just as we
were sailing along, like the wind, whom
should we overtake but my Lady Hauton,
lounging her lazy way (she thinks it
aristocratic!) on the back seat of her
father's heavy, clumsy barouche&mdash;not a
soul in it but her mother and herself.
Didn't I bow graciously to her as we flew
by! and again, as we met them creeping
along, when we were coming back? I
wouldn't have missed the chance of mortifying
her for a thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Lucy laughed, with no sign of disapprobation
at the coarse, vindictive spirit
displayed in this petty triumph of a small
soul.</p>

<p>"How many evening dresses have you put
down on your paper, Vic.?"</p>

<p>"Half a dozen only. I will get others as
I need them. The styles in these change
so often that I do not care to have too
many at a time."</p>

<p>"There you will have the advantage of
me," said Lucy, ingenuously. "It will not
be so easy a matter to replenish my stock
of wearable dresses. I wish I had asked
Philip about the Savannah stores. I wonder
if he knows anything about them?"</p>

<p>"He ought to&mdash;being such a connoisseur
in ladies' dress. I declare I have been
absolutely afraid of him since I heard him
say that he considered a lady's apparel a
criterion of her character."</p>

<p>"He has exquisite taste!" said Lucy,
with pardonable pride in her lover. "It is
a positive pleasure to dress for him. He
sees and appreciates everything that I
could wish to have him notice. He has
often described to me what I wore, and
how I looked and acted the evening he fell
in love. How little we can guess what is
before us! I did not care to go to the hop
that night, for Mr. Finch was to wait on
me, and he was so stupid, you know, after
we discovered that it was a mistake about
his being rich. I think I see him now, with
his red face and short neck! Oh, dear! the
fun we had over that poor man! I told
you&mdash;didn't I, Sarah&mdash;that we named him
Bullfinch, because he looked so much like
one? When Phil came we called him Goldfinch,
and the two went by these names
among us girls. The Bullfinch heard of it,
and he was ridiculously angry! So I put on
a white tarlatan, that one with the double
jupe, you know, Vic., festooned with white
moss rosebuds, and I had nothing but a
tea-rose in my hair. I danced once with
the Bullfinch&mdash;one of those solemn quadrilles
that are only fit for grandmothers&mdash;and
vowed to myself that I would not
stand up again, except for a polka or the
lancers. While I was sitting down by the
window, saying 'Yes' and 'No,' when Bullfinch
spoke, Mr. Newman introduced 'Mr.
Benson' to 'Miss Hunt,' and the work was
done!"</p>

<p>"No more waltzing, then!" was Victoria's
slyly malicious sequel.</p>

<p>"I did not care so much for that as I
thought I should!" replied easy-tempered
Lucy. "You cannot find a man who has
not some drawback. Before I had a chance
for another round, mother there managed
to telegraph me that my fresh acquaintance
was worth catching. She had gotten
his whole story out of Mrs. Newman. He
let me know pretty soon, that he had
some queer scruples about fancy dances,
and I thought it best to humor him for
one evening, or until I should ascertain
whether he was really 'taken' or not. I
have never repented my self-denial, although
I grant that it cost me a struggle
to give up 'the german.'"</p>

<p>"George lets me waltz to my heart's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
content," said Victoria. "He is the very
soul of indulgence. As to laces&mdash;I have not
a thing fit to wear. I must get everything
new. I am glad of it! I enjoy shopping
for them. If I have a passion, it is for
laces!"</p>

<p>A sneer curled Sarah's lips, and Victoria
happening to glance that way, could not
mistake its application, whatever she might
surmise as to its origin.</p>

<p>"I suppose you despise us as a couple of
lovesick girls, Sarah?" she said, with a
simper designed to be sentimental, whereas
it was spiteful instead.</p>

<p>"I think love the least dangerous of
your complaints," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I said."</p>

<p>"She means that people do not die of love
in these days," exclaimed Lucy, whose
pleasure-loving nature always shuddered at
the idea of altercation in her presence; her
sensations, during the occasional sparrings
of her sister and her friend, bearing a
strong resemblance to those of an innocent
white rabbit, into whose burrow a couple
of belligerent hedgehogs have forced their
way.</p>

<p>"You will understand us better one day,
when your turn comes," said Victoria,
with magnanimous condescension. "I shall
remind you then of your good opinion of
us."</p>

<p>"You may."</p>

<p>"I would give anything to have you engaged,
just to see how you would behave.
Would not you, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if she were likely to do as well as
we are doing. Philip says that you have
many fine qualities, Sarah. He quite admires
you."</p>

<p>The complacent betrothed had none but
the most amiable intentions in making this
patronizing speech; therefore, the angry
blood that surged over her sister's face at
hearing it would have been to her but the
blush of gratified vanity, had not the
sparkle of her eye and the contemptuous
contortion of her mouth undeceived her.</p>

<p>"Indeed he did say so!" she hastened to
repeat. "And he was in earnest! He said
something else which I don't mind telling,
now that he belongs to me fast and sure.
He said that he sat up until twelve o'clock
one night after you had been out boating
deliberating whether he should be smitten
with you or not. There!"</p>

<p>The color retreated as quickly as it had
come. But for the consciousness of Victoria's
malicious scrutiny, Sarah could not
have summoned strength to utter a word.</p>

<p>"An equivocal compliment, I must say!"
she retorted, sarcastically. "Your gallant
Georgian's confessions must have been
ample and minute indeed, if they comprised
such distant approaches to love
affairs as the one you honor me by mentioning.
I do not think that I have ever
heard of another case where a gentleman
considered it necessary to enumerate to his
fiancee, not merely the ladies he had loved,
but those whom he had not!" She arose
and left the room.</p>

<p>Poor Lucy, rebuffed and overwhelmed,
caught her astonished breath with a sigh.
"Can anybody tell me what I have done
now to fret Sarah? She is so cross since
she was sick!"</p>

<p>"And before, too!" mutely added Victoria's
shrug and lifted eyebrows.</p>

<p>"We must bear with her, my dear!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the prudent mother. "Her nerves are affected,
the doctor says."</p>

<p>Victoria made random pencillings upon
the important list&mdash;her thoughts in fast
pursuit of a notion that had just struck
her. She was neither witty nor intelligent;
but she possessed some natural
shrewdness and a great deal more acquired
cunning. She detested Sarah Hunt, and the
prospect of obtaining an engine that should
humble her arrogant spirit was scarcely
less tempting than her own chance of effecting
an advantageous matrimonial settlement.</p>

<p>While she was engaged in defining her
suspicion to herself, and concerting measures
for gathering information with regard
to it, Mrs. Hunt went out on some household
errand, and Lucy was obliged to descend
to the parlor to see callers.</p>

<p>"Don't go until I come back, Vic.. It is
the Dunhams, and they never stay long,"
she said, at quitting her associate.</p>

<p>"Oh, I always make myself at home
here, you know, my dear!" was the reply.</p>

<p>Jeannie was sitting on a cushion near the
chair Sarah had occupied, dressing her
doll.</p>

<p>"It won't fit!" she cried, fretfully,
snatching off a velvet basque she had
been endeavoring to adjust to the lay-figure.</p>

<p>"Bring it to me! I can fix it!" offered
Victoria, winningly. "It's too tight just
here, you see. I will rip open the seam
and alter it. Who makes your dolly's
clothes?"</p>

<p>She was well aware that but one member
of the family ever had leisure to bestow
upon such follies; but it suited her plan for
Jeannie to introduce the name.</p>

<p>"Sister Sarah."</p>

<p>"This is a pretty basque. When did she
make it?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh! I thought perhaps she did it while
you were in the country, and that the doll
had fattened as much as you did there."</p>

<p>Jeannie laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You had a nice time there, I suppose?"
pursued Victoria.</p>

<p>"I guess we did!" Her eyes danced at
the recollection. "A splendid time! I
wish we lived at Aunt Sarah's! There
isn't room for me to move in this narrow
house."</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson was there a day or two,
was he not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am&mdash;a great many days! He
took us all around the country in Uncle
Nathan's carriage. I love him very dearly."</p>

<p>"Did you ever go sailing with him?"</p>

<p>"Every evening, when it was clear, in a
pretty rowboat. He used to take his guitar
along, and sing for us. He sings beautifully!
Did you ever hear him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Did your sister always go boating
with you?"</p>

<p>The spy, with all her hardihood, lowered
her voice, and felt her face warm as she
put this leading question.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, always. Mr. Benson
would not have gone without her, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Why do you guess so?"</p>

<p>The little girl smiled knowingly. "Because&mdash;you
won't tell, will you?"</p>

<p>"Why no! Of course I will not."</p>

<p>"Charley said it was a secret, and that I
mustn't say anything to sister or Mr. Benson
about it, for they would be angry."</p>

<p>"Who is Charley?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? He is Aunt Sarah's
son. He is deaf and dumb; but he showed
me how to spell on my fingers. He is a
nice boy"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; but what was the secret?"</p>

<p>"He said that Mr. Benson&mdash;Cousin Phil I
call him when I am talking to him&mdash;was
sister's beau; and he would take me off
with him when we went to drive or walk,
because, you know, they might not like to
have me hear what they were talking
about. They used to talk, and talk, and
talk! and sister had a great deal more to
say, and looked prettier than she does at
home. I will tell you something else, if you
won't ever let anybody know it. I never
told Aunt Sarah even, only Charley. Sister
cried ever so long the night after
Cousin Phil went away. She woke me up
sobbing; but I made believe that I was
asleep; and in the morning her pillow was
right wet. Charley said that all ladies
that he had read about in his books did so
when their beaux left them."</p>

<p>"See here, my little lady!" said the dissembler,
with a startling change of tone.
"You are altogether mistaken&mdash;you and
Charley both! Mr. Benson is going to
marry your sister Lucy, and never was a
beau of Sarah's. Be very careful not to
talk about Charley's wicked story to your
father, or mother, or sisters, for they
would be very much displeased, and maybe
punish you for repeating such fibs. Little
girls ought never to hear or know anything
about courting or beaux&mdash;it's
naughty! I won't tell on you, if you will
promise never to do so again. I am
shocked at you! Now take your doll and
go!"</p>

<p>The frightened child encountered Lucy at
the door. Miss West had calculated her
time to a minute. Her eyes swimming in
tears, her features convulsed with the
effort to keep back sob and outcry, Jeannie
started up to her attic playroom. Sarah's
door was ajar, and engaged as she was
with thoughts of her own troubles and insults,
she could not but remark the expression
of her darling's face, in the momentary
glimpse she had as it passed.</p>

<p>"Jeannie! come back!" she called.</p>

<p>The child hesitated, half way up the next
flight. Sarah repeated the summons, and
seeing that it was not obeyed, went up and
took the rebel by the hand.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>A reddening and distortion of visage, and
no reply. Her sister led her back to her
chamber, shut the door, and put her arms
around her.</p>

<p>"Tell me what ails you, dear!"</p>

<p>Jeannie fell upon her comforter's neck&mdash;the
repressed torrent breaking through
all restraint. "Oh, sister, I can't help crying!
Miss Vic. West has been scolding me!"</p>

<p>"Scolding you! She! I will go down and
speak to her this instant! How dared
she?"</p>

<p>"No, no! please don't! She told me not to
say anything about it."</p>

<p>"The contemptible coward!" said Sarah,
between her teeth. "How came you to
have anything to do with her?"</p>

<p>"Mother and sister Lucy went downstairs,
and she said she would alter my
doll's basque and&mdash;and&mdash;and"&mdash;a fresh burst
of lamentation.</p>

<p>"There, that will do, pet! I see that she
only made it worse!" soothed Sarah, believing
that, in the unfinished state of dolly's
wardrobe, she had discovered the root of
the trouble. "Never mind, dear! I will set
all that to rights directly. Now wipe your
eyes, and let me tell you something. This
afternoon father is to take me to ride, and
you shall go, too. As for Miss Victoria,
we will let her pass, and keep out of her
way, hereafter."</p>

<p>Secretly, she was very angry&mdash;far more
so than she was willing to have the child
suspect. As the patient fingers repaired
the effects of the original bad fit, and Miss
West's meddling, Jeannie stood by, thankful
and interested, yet ashamed to look her
wronged sister in the eyes. Not that she
had the remotest conception of the mischief
that might grow out of her imprudent disclosures;
but she had broken faith with
Charley, been accused of tattling and indelicacy,
and warned too stringently
against repeating the offence to suffer her
to relieve her conscience by a full confession
to the being she most loved and
honored.</p>

<p>At four o'clock Sarah and her charge
were ready, according to Mr. Hunt's appointment.
The carriage was likewise
punctual; but from it stepped, not the
parent of the expectant girls, but a
younger and taller man&mdash;in short, Mr.
Hunt's particular favorite&mdash;Lewis Hammond.
Jeannie, who had stationed herself
at an upper window to watch for her
father's appearance, was still exclaiming
over this disappointment, and wondering
why "Mr. Hammond must call just now to
keep sister at home," when the footman
brought up a note to Sarah.</p>

<p>It was from Mr. Hunt, explaining the
cause of his unlooked-for detention at the
bank, and stating that Mr. Hammond,
whom he had met earlier in the day, and
acquainted with his design of giving his
daughter this ride, happened to drop in,
and seeing him engaged with business, had
asked leave to officiate as his substitute in
the proposed airing. He urged Sarah to
take Jeannie along, and not hesitate to accept
Mr. Hammond's polite attendance,
adding, in phrase brief, but sincere, how
lightly he should esteem his hour of extra
labor, if he knew that she was not a sufferer
by it.</p>

<p>Sarah passed the note to her mother, and
drew her shawl about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Of course you'll go!" said Mrs. Hunt,
radiant with gratification. "It is perfectly
proper, and Mr. Hammond is very kind,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>She was hurrying towards the door to
convey in person her thanks for his gallantry,
when Sarah spoke firmly and very
coolly:</p>

<p>"I will say whatever is necessary to Mr.
Hammond, if you please, mother. I shall
go because father wishes it, and for no
other reason. Come, Jeannie!"</p>

<p>"Won't she be in your way?" asked Mrs.
Hunt, awed, but not extinguished.</p>

<p>"No, madam."</p>

<p>Sarah suffered Mr. Hammond to place her
in the carriage, and himself opposite to
her; and keeping before her mind carefully
the fact that he was her father's friend,
perhaps the savior of his life, she unbent,
as much as she could, from her distant,
ungracious bearing, to sustain her part of
the conversation. She must have been
purblind not to see through her mother's
wishes, and manoeuvres for their accomplishment;
but to these views she was persuaded
that Mr. Hammond was no party.
She saw in him a sedate, rather reserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
gentleman of thirty-two or three, who had
passed the heyday of youthful loves and
joy; sensible and cultivated to an uncommon
degree for a man of business&mdash;for such
he emphatically was.</p>

<p>A poor boy in the beginning, he had fortunately
attracted the regard of a thriving
New York merchant, and retained that
favor through the years that had elevated
him from the lowest clerkship to a partnership
in the now opulent firm. For probity
and punctuality no man in the city had a
higher reputation; but his virtues were of
that quiet nature which, while they inevitably
retain regard once won, are slow
to gain admiration. To matrimonial speculators,
as in financial circles, he was known
as a "safe chance," and many a prudent
mamma on his list of acquaintances would
have rejoiced had he selected her daughter
as mistress of his heart and fortune.
Whether he was aware of this or not could
not have been determined by his modest,
but dignified deportment. He did not
avoid company; went whither he was invited,
and, when there, comported himself
like a conscientious member of society,
talking, dancing, or listening, with as due
regard to law and order as he manifested
in his daily business life. Fast girls called
him "awfully matter-of-fact," and "terribly
sensible"; fast youths of the other
sex put him down among the "old fogies,"
and wondered what he did with his money.
"Could it be possible that he saved it!"
He was intimate nowhere except in the
household of his whilom employer and
present partner, whose daughters were all
married and settled in houses of their own.
If he had ever cared to look twice at the
same lady, the watchful world had not yet
laid hold of this marvellous departure
from his fixed habits.</p>

<p>His intercourse with Mr. Hunt's family
was, as we know, purely accidental in its
commencement, and in its earlier stages
might have been induced by humanity or
friendship for the sick father. In Sarah's
brain there had never arisen a suspicion
of any ulterior motives in the pointed attentions
directed of late to herself. Before
Lucy's return, the care of her invalid parent
and her day-dreams had engrossed
heart and thought to an extent that precluded
much inquiry into other themes.
Since that memorable night, inward torture
had abstracted her mind still more
from outward impressions.</p>

<p>This afternoon she talked calmly and indifferently
to Mr. Hammond, without an
idea that he made any greater effort to
please her. To Jeannie she was tender beyond
her usual showing, in remembrance
of the wrong done the sensitive child in the
forenoon. Mr. Hammond emulated her in
kindness to the third member of their
party; and in the course of their ride,
raised himself unwittingly to the rank of
rivalship with "Cousin Philip," her model
gentleman.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt came out to assist his daughter
to alight, upon their return. There was a
heartiness in his acknowledgment of his
deputy's politeness, and invitation to enter
the house and pass the evening with them,
which Sarah had seldom heard him employ
towards any visitor. Mr. Hammond may
have remarked it likewise, for his declinature
was evidently against his inclination,
and coupled with a promise to call at an
early day. His visits were not altogether
so agreeable as formerly, for he was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in the spacious parlors on a footing
with other callers, and in the presence of
several members of the family; still he
came repeatedly, with pretext and without,
until his sentiments and design were a
secret to no one except their object.</p>

<p>Wrapped in the sad thoughts that isolated
her from the rest of the world, even while
she made a part of its show, Sarah omitted
to mark many things that should have been
significant signs of undercurrents, and
tokens of important issues to her and
those about her. Lucy had ceased to harp
perpetually upon her lover's perfections
and idolatrous flattery to herself, and while
the wedding arrangements went vigorously
forward, the disengaged sister was rarely
annoyed by references to her taste and demands
for her sympathy. There had never
existed much congeniality between the two,
and their common ground was now exceedingly
narrow. Lucy was gentle and pleasant,
peacefully egotistic as ever, and Sarah
understood her too well to expect active
affection or disinterestedness. The only
part of her behavior to herself to which
she took mental exception was a certain
pitying forbearance, a compassionate leniency
with respect to her faults and foibles,
that had grown upon her of late. Once
or twice the younger sister had become so
restive under this gratuitous charity as to
reply sharply to the whey-like speeches of
the mild elder, and, without any appearance
of wounded feeling, yet with not a
word of apology or reason for so doing,
Lucy had left the apartment, and never
hinted at the circumstances afterwards.</p>

<p>Lucy was certainly the soul, the very
cream of amiability. It was unaccountable
to her admirers&mdash;and they included most of
her associates&mdash;that Lewis Hammond, with
his peculiar habits and tastes, should prefer
that severe-looking, strong-minded
Sarah. But, be it remembered, that he had
learned this love under far different influences;
in circumstances wholly unlike
those in which he now beheld its object.
His respect for unobtrusive intent and
feeling; his longing for a home which
should be the abode of sacred domestic virtues;
and the sweet peace that had fled
from the habitations frequented only by
the frivolous, heartless, and vain&mdash;these
found in the sick-room of the father, and
the affectionate fidelity of the daughter,
something so like the embodiment of his
fancy of earthly happiness, that he accepted
as a benignant fate the accident
which had admitted him to the arcana of
their private life. Sarah's temporary illness
had taught him the meaning of his
dreams, by seeming to peril the chances of
their fulfilment; and from that hour he
strove patiently and sedulously, as it was
his habit, to seek all great ends for the
acquisition of the heart whose depth he
perhaps, of all who knew her, best understood.</p>

<p>The most impatient person of those directly
or indirectly concerned in the progress
of this wooing was Mrs. Hunt. Her
husband, with unwonted firmness, had forbidden
that anyone of the household should
speak a word in raillery or otherwise to
Sarah touching Mr. Hammond's intentions.
"However earnestly I may desire
his success," he said to his wife&mdash;"and
there is no man living whom I would
rather call 'son'&mdash;I would not influence her
by the weight of a single syllable. Hers is
the happiness or the misery of a life with
her husband&mdash;whomsoever she may choose,
and hers shall be the entire choice. If she
can love and marry Lewis Hammond, I
shall be gratified; if not, she shall never
guess at my disappointment."</p>

<p>"La, Mr. H.! you are as foolish and sentimental
as the girl herself! For my part,
I ain't such a saint, and I do say, that if
Sarah Hunt allows such a catch as this to
slip through her fingers, she shall hear a
piece of my mind!"</p>

<p>"I insist," said Mr. Hunt, with immovable
resolution, "that Sarah shall be allowed
to follow the guidance of her own
will in this matter. It is not often that I
interfere with your plans; but in this one
instance I must be obeyed!"</p>

<p>With which astounding declaration of
equal rights, if not of sovereignty, he left
his consort to her reflections.</p>

<p>Ignorant of the delicate watchfulness
maintained over her by this best of friends,
Sarah walked on her beclouded way&mdash;without
hope, without one anticipation of any
future dissimilar to her present, until
awakened with a shock by a formal declaration
of love from Lewis Hammond.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>It was at the close of an evening party
which both the Hunts attended, and where
Mr. Hammond's devotion was as marked
as anything so modest could be, that Sarah
felt him slip an envelope into her hand, as
he put her into the carriage. Surprised as
she was at the singularity of the occurrence,
and disposed to take offence at the
familiarity it implied, she had yet the
presence of mind to conceal the missive
from Lucy, and talk about other things,
until they were set down at home. In the
privacy of her chamber, she broke the seal
and read her first love letter.</p>

<p>It was a characteristic composition. If
the strong hand had trembled above the
lines, the clear, clerkly penmanship did not
witness to the weakness. Nor was there
anything in the subject matter that did not
appear to Sarah as business-like and unimpassioned.
It was a frank and manly
avowal of attachment for her; a compliment
implied, rather than broadly stated,
to her virtues; the traits that had gained
his esteem, then his love&mdash;a deprecatory
sentence as to his ability to deserve the
treasure he dared to ask&mdash;and then the
question! in plain black and white, unequivocal
to bluntness, simple and direct to
curtness.</p>

<p>"As he would ask the price of a bale of
goods!" burst forth Sarah, indignant, as
she threw the paper on the floor, and
buried her burning face in her hands.</p>

<p>"That there comes sometimes a glory to
the Present, besides which the hues of
Past and Future fade and are forgotten, I
must and will believe. Such, it seems to
me, must be the rapture of acknowledged
and reciprocal affection!" This was an
echo memory repeated to her soul. She saw
again the gently gliding river, with its
waves of crimson and gold; breathed the
pure fragrance of the summer evening;
floated on, towards the sunset, with the
loved voice in her ear; the dawn of a
strange and beautiful life, shedding blissful
calm throughout her being.</p>

<p>And from this review, dangerous as it
was for one fleeting instant sweet, she
returned to the proposal that had
amazed and angered her. Lewis' undemonstrative
exterior had misled her, as it did
most persons, in the estimate of his inner
nature. Kind, she was compelled to confess
that he was, in remembrance of his
goodness to her father; his demeanor was
always gentlemanly, and she had caught
here and there rumors of his generosity to
the needy that prevented a suspicion of
sordidness. No doubt he was very well in
his way, but he wanted to marry her!
With the intensity of her fiery spirit, her will
arose against the presumptuous request.
It was the natural recoil of the woman
who already loves, at the suggestion of a
union with another than the man of her
choice; the spontaneous outspeaking of a
heart whose allegiance vows have been
pledged and cannot be nullified. But she
would not see this. Upon the unfortunate
letter and its writer descended the storm
of passionate repugnance aroused by its
contents. With the reaction of excited
feeling came tears&mdash;a plentiful shower that
relaxed the overwrought nerves, until they
were ready to receive the benediction of
sleep.</p>

<p>Lewis had not asked a written or verbal
reply.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I will call to take you to drive to-morrow
afternoon," he wrote. "Should your decision
upon the question I have proposed be favorable,
your consent to accompany me in my ride will
be understood as a signal that you have
accepted my graver suit. If your conclusion is
adverse to my hopes, you can signify the same
to me in a letter, to be handed me when I ask
for you. This course will spare us both
embarrassment&mdash;perhaps pain. In any event, be
assured that you will ever have a firm friend
in, Yours truly,</p>

<p>
"Lewis Hammond."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Sarah's lip curled as she reperused this
clause of the letter on the following morning.</p>

<p>"It is a comfort to know that I have not
to answer for the sin of breaking my ardent
suitor's heart!" she said, as she drew
towards her the sheet upon which she was
to indite her refusal. It was brief and
courteous&mdash;freezing in its punctilious civility,
and prepared without a pang, or a
solitary misgiving that its reception would
not be philosophically calm. Her design
was to intrust it to the footman, to be delivered
when Mr. Hammond called; and as
the hour approached at which the expectant
was to present himself, she took
the note from the desk and started downstairs
with it.</p>

<p>The sitting-room door was open, and,
aware that Victoria West was in there
with Lucy, Sarah trod very softly as she
neared it. Her own name arrested her as
she was going by. She stopped involuntarily.</p>

<p>"I thought Sarah a girl of better regulated
mind," said Victoria, in a tone of
censorious pity. "Of course she suffers!
It is the inevitable consequence of an unrequited
attachment. Such miserable folly,
such unpardonable weakness brings its
punishment with it. But my sympathies
are all yours, my dearest. I only wish you
were not so sensitive. You are not to
blame for her blind mistake."</p>

<p>"I cannot help it!" said Lucy, plaintively.
"It seems so sad that I should be made the
means of depriving her of happiness. I
wish I had never known that she was attached
to poor Philip. I can't tell you how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
awkward I feel when any allusion is made
in her hearing to the dear fellow, or to
our marriage."</p>

<p>"I meant it for the best, dear, in telling
you of my discovery," replied Victoria,
slightly hurt.</p>

<p>"I know that, my dear creature! And it
is well that I should not be kept in the
dark as to the state of her affections. I
only hope that Philip never penetrated her
secret. I should die of mortification for her
if he were to find it out. It is a lamentable
affair&mdash;and I am sure that he is not in
fault. What did you say that you gave
for that set of handkerchiefs you showed
me yesterday?"</p>

<p>"The cheapest things you ever saw! I
got them at Stewart's, and they averaged
six dollars apiece! As to Mr. Benson, I
trust, with you, that he is as unsuspecting
as he seems; but he has remarkable discernment,
you know. What I could not
help seeing, before I had any other proof
than her behavior, is not likely to have
escaped him."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the twain were disturbed
in their confidences by the sound of
wheels stopping before the house, followed
by a ring at the door. Victoria, ever on
the alert, peeped, with feline caution and
curiosity, around the edge of the curtain.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen? Look, Lucy!
Mr. Hammond in a handsome light carriage,
and driving a lovely pair of horses!
I never thought to see him go in such
style. How well he looks! Take care! he
will see you!"</p>

<p>Both dodged as he glanced up at the
upper windows; but resumed their lookout
in time to see the light that was
kindled in his face when Sarah emerged
from the front door. He was at her side in
a second, to lead her down the steps, and
his manner in this movement, and in assisting
her into the carriage, the more
striking in one generally so self-contained
and deliberate, inspired the pair of initiated
observers with the same conviction. As
the spirited horses disappeared into the
avenue, the friends drew back from their
loophole, and stared each other in the eyes,
with the simultaneous exclamation&mdash;"They
are engaged!"</p>

<p>They were engaged! Lewis felt it with a
glad bound of the heart&mdash;but a minute before
sickening in deadly suspense; felt, as
he seated himself by her side, that the sorrows
of a lonely and struggling youth, the
years of manhood's isolation and unsatisfied
longings, were swept from memory by
this hour of abundant, unalloyed happiness.</p>

<p>And Sarah felt it! As her hand touched
his, at their meeting upon the steps, a
chill ran through her frame that told the
consummation of the sacrifice which was
to atone for past folly; to silence, and
brand as a lying rumor, the fearful tale
that bruited abroad the revelation of that
weakness. In her mad horror at the knowledge
of its discovery, she had rushed upon
this alternative. Better an estate of
honorable misery, than to live on, solitary,
disgraced, condemned and pitied by her
meanest foe! Now that the irreversible
step was taken, she experienced no sharp
regret, no wild impulse of retreat, but a
gradual sinking of spirit into hopeless
apathy.</p>

<p>Her veil concealed her dull eyes and
stolid features, and to Lewis' happy mood
there was nothing surprising or discouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in her disposition to silence. With a
tact for which she had not given him
credit, and did not now value aright, he
refrained from any direct reference to
their altered relation until they were returning
homeward. Then changing his
tone of pleasant chat for one of deeper
meaning, he said:</p>

<p>"I have dared to hope much&mdash;everything&mdash;from
your consent to become my companion
for this afternoon. Before I ventured
to address you directly, I had a long and
frank conversation with your father."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" asked Sarah, turning
towards him for the first time.</p>

<p>"He referred me to you for my answer,
which, he said, must be final and positive,
since he would never attempt to influence
your choice. In the event of an affirmative
reply from you, he promised that his
sanction should not be withheld."</p>

<p>Sarah was silent. She comprehended
fully her father's warm interest in his
friend's suit, which the speaker was too
diffident to imply, and how this expression
of his wishes set the seal upon her fate.</p>

<p>"We are poor and proud! Mr. Hammond
is rich and seeks to marry me!" was her
bitter thought. "It is a fine bargain in the
eyes of both my parents. It would be high
treason for me to dispute their will. Mr.
Hammond has conceived the notion that I
am a useful domestic character, a good
housekeeper and nurse, and he is willing
to bid liberally for my services. It is all
arranged between them! Mine is a passive
part, to copy Lucy's sweet, submissive
ways for a season, for fear of frightening
away the game, afterwards to attend to my
business, while he looks after his. I have
chosen my lot, and I will abide by it!"</p>

<p>"Have I your permission to call this
evening and inform your father of my success&mdash;may
I say of our engagement?" asked
Lewis.</p>

<p>"It is best, I suppose, to call things by
their right names," replied Sarah, in a cold
voice, that was to him only coy. He smiled,
and was about to speak, when she resumed:
"Since we are virtually engaged"&mdash;she
caught her breath as she brought out
the word&mdash;"I see no reason why we should
hesitate to announce it to those whose
right it is to know it."</p>

<p>"Thank you! That was spoken like the
noble, unaffected woman you are! Will you
always be equally sincere with me&mdash;Sarah?"
His accent trembled with excess
of emotion in calling the name.</p>

<p>Is it, then, an easy lot that you have
chosen, Sarah Hunt? You, whose pride
and glory it was to be truthful, who
spurned whatever assimilated in the least
degree to deception, what think you of a
life where a lie meets you on the threshold
and must be accepted and perpetuated if
you would preserve your name and position
in his eyes and those of the world. "It is
the way two-thirds of the married people
live!" you were saying to yourself, just
now. It may be so; but it is none the less
a career of duplicity, perjury&mdash;crime!</p>

<p>"I will endeavor to please you!" she faltered,
her face in a flame of shame and
confusion.</p>

<p>And this was the hue that met Lewis'
eye, as her veil was blown aside, in her
descent to the pavement, a blush he interpreted
to suit his own wishes. Mr. Hunt
appeared in the doorway as she alighted,
and read in Hammond's smile and joyous
salutation all that he most desired to learn.
When the door was closed upon the departing
suitor, the father drew his best-beloved
child to him, and kissed her, without
a word of uttered blessing.</p>

<p>"It would break his heart were I to recede
now!" thought Sarah, as she bore hers&mdash;heavy,
hard&mdash;up to her room.</p>

<p>That evening was the proudest era of
Mrs. Hunt's existence. Two daughters
well engaged&mdash;unexceptionably paired off!
What mother more blest than she? Where
could be found other children so dutiful?
other sons-in-law so acceptable? By
breakfast time, next day, she had arranged
everything&mdash;Sarah's trousseau, her house,
and the double wedding.</p>

<p>Lucy expostulated here. "But, mother,
this is the first of November."</p>

<p>"I know that, my dear; but the ceremony
will not come off until Christmas,
and much can be done in six weeks for
your sister&mdash;your work is so forward.
Then, again, 'tisn't as if Sarah couldn't get
everything she needs right here, if she
shouldn't have enough. It will be tremendously
expensive&mdash;awful, in fact; but
we must make sacrifices. We can live
economical after you're married and gone,
and save enough to meet the bills."</p>

<p>"If you please, madam, I prefer a plain
outfit and no debts," said Sarah's most
abrupt tones.</p>

<p>"If you please, my dear, I understand my
affairs, and mean to do as I think proper,"
retorted the no less strong-willed mother.</p>

<p>Sarah was not cowed. "And as to the
time you set, I cannot agree to it. I presume
that in this matter I have some
voice. I say six months instead of six
weeks!"</p>

<p>"Very well, my love." Mrs. Hunt went on
polishing a tumbler with her napkin. She
always washed her silver and glass herself.
"You must settle that with your father
and Mr. Hammond. They are crazy for
this plan. They were talking to me about
it last night, and I told them that I would
engage to have everything ready in time;
but you must be consulted. I never saw
your father more set upon anything. He
said to me, private, that he did hope that
you wouldn't raise any squeamish objections,
and upset their arrangements."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt took up a handful of spoons as
composedly as if she had never stretched
her conscience in her life.</p>

<p>Sarah's head drooped upon the table. She
was very, very miserable. In her morbid
state of mind she did not dream of questioning
the accuracy of her mother's assertion.
That a marriageable single
daughter was a burden to one parent, she
knew but too well; that to this able financier
the prospect of getting two out of the
way, with the eclat of a double ceremony
that should cost no more than Lucy's
nuptials would have done, was a stupendous
temptation, she also perceived. But
that the father whom she so loved; whose
sickbed she had tended so faithfully; whose
lonely hours it was her province and delight
to solace&mdash;that he should acquiesce&mdash;nay
more, rejoice in this indelicate haste to
get rid of her, was a cruel stab.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, raising an ashy
face. "Let it be as you say. The sooner
it is over, the better."</p>

<p>This clause was unheeded by her mother
and sister. Had they heard it, they might
have understood it as little as they did the
composure with which she joined in the
work which was begun, without an hour's
delay. In this trying juncture, Mrs. Hunt
came out in all her strength. Her sewing
machine (she was one of the earliest purchasers
of these inestimable time, labor,
and money savers) went night and day; she
shopped largely and judiciously, giving orders
to tradespeople with the air of a princess;
"Jewed" her butcher; watched her
pantry, and served up poorer dinners than
ever. Jeannie's winter outfit was ingeniously
contrived from her sister's cast-off
wardrobe; Mr. Hunt's and the boys' shirts
and socks were patched and darned until
but a trifling quantity of the original material
remained; and this pearl of mothers
had her two-year-old cloak and last season's
hat "done over" for this year's wear.</p>

<p>Foremost among the visitors to the Hunts,
after this latest engagement was made
public, was Mrs. Marlow, the wife of Mr.
Hammond's benefactor and partner. Sarah
was out when she called; so Mrs. Hunt
received her, and discovering very soon
that in spite of her husband's wealth and
her splendid establishment, she was not,
as Mrs. Hunt phrased it to her daughters,
"one mite proud, and thought the world
and all of Lewis"&mdash;the mother opened her
heart to her so freely, with regard to the
prospective weddings and her material
anxieties, that Mrs. Marlow was emboldened
to introduce a subject which had
taken hold of her thoughts so soon as she
heard from Mr. Hammond of his expected
marriage.</p>

<p>She had a daughter, resident for the
winter in Paris, whose taste in female
attire was unquestionable, and her good-nature
as praiseworthy. If Miss Sarah
Hunt would prepare a memorandum of
such articles as she would like to have
selected in that emporium of fashion, she
would promise, for her daughter, that they
should be forwarded in time for "the occasion."</p>

<p>"Some friends of mine, now abroad, have
kindly offered to bring me over any quantity
of fine dresses with their baggage,"
said the complaisant old lady; "and, as I
do not need their services for myself, I
can smuggle in whatever your daughter
may order. You would be surprised at the
difference in prices here and there&mdash;to say
nothing of the superior excellence and
variety of the assortment from which one
can choose. My friends will return early
in December. Therefore, should you like
this arrangement, I ought to have the
list and write my letters to-morrow."</p>

<p>Energetic, fussy, snobbish Mrs. Hunt!
She stood an inch taller in her shoes at
the imagination of this climax to the
glory of the dual ceremony. "Trousseau
ordered directly from Paris!" She seemed
already to hear the envious and admiring
buzz of her set; saw herself the most
blessed of women&mdash;her daughters the brides
of the season. She would order for Lucy,
also; for the longer the list the more importance
would the future Mrs. Hammond
acquire in the sight of her husband's
friends. They could not know that it was
not for her alone. Then, as Mrs. Marlow
intimated, it would be a saving. Here,
like a cold shower-bath, came the agonizing
query, "Where was the money to come
from?" It would never do to run in debt
to such people as the Marlows. If they
were hard-pressed shopkeepers, who needed
the money, it would be another thing.
No! the cash in hand, or its representative,
must accompany the memorandum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Sarah was secretly pleased at this obstacle,
for she despised the ostentation and
extravagance going on in their hungry
household. Strive as she did, with wicked
pertinacity, to conform herself to the
world's code, there was as yet too much
of the ancient and better leaven left to
permit more than an outward obedience to
the dictates of customs so irrational and
tyrannical.</p>

<p>That very evening there arrived a letter
that settled the question, and inflated Mrs.
Hunt's collapsed spirits to an expansion
hitherto unequalled. It was from Aunt
Sarah to her namesake niece; a guileless,
fervent expression of good wishes and unabated
affection, and a request from "husband"
and herself that she would accept
the enclosure as a mark of that hopeful
regard.</p>

<p>"Since our daughters died"&mdash;wrote this
true and gentle mother&mdash;"we have always
intended to give you just exactly what
we would have done one of them, as a
wedding present&mdash;as you were named for
me, and I had nursed you before your
mother ever did, and you seemed in some
way to belong to us. But since you paid
us a visit we have felt nearer to you than
ever, and seeing that the Lord has prospered
us in this world's goods, we have
made up our minds to give you a double
portion, dear, what both of our girls would
have had, if it had pleased our Father to
spare them to have homes of their own
upon earth. Living is high in New York,
but we have calculated that what we send
will buy your wedding clothes and furnish
your house."</p>

<p>The enclosed gift, to Sarah's astonishment,
was a check upon a city bank for a
thousand dollars!</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a child for luck?"
exclaimed Mrs. Hunt, clapping her hands.
"What a fortunate thing we sent you down
there when we did! That was one of my
plans, you remember, Mr. H. Really, Lucy,
our little Sarah understands how to play
her cards, after all. I never did you justice,
my dear daughter. I ain't ashamed
to confess it. This puts all straight, and
is real handsome in sister Benson&mdash;more
than I expected. Go to work right away
upon your list, girls! We'll have to set
up the best part of the night to get it
ready. Ah, well! this comes of putting
one's trust in Providence and going
ahead!"</p>

<p>Sarah thought, with aching heart and
moistened eyes, of Aunt Sarah's mind-pictures
of the neat apparel and snug dwelling
she deemed proper for a young couple
just beginning housekeeping, and rebelled
at this waste, this frivolous expenditure
of her love-portion. Mr. Hunt sided with
her, so far as to urge the propriety of her
doing as she pleased with what was her
exclusive property; but, as in a majority
of former altercations, their arguments and
powers of endurance were no match for
the determination and mind of the real
head of the family. With a sigh of pain,
disgust, and despair, Mr. Hunt succumbed,
and, deserted by her ally, Sarah contended
but a short time longer ere she yielded
up the cause of the combat to the indomitable
victress.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>The bridal day came; frosty and clear,
dazzlingly bright, by reason of the reflection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
from the snow, which lay deep
and firm upon the ground.</p>

<p>"What a delightful novelty this is, coming
to a wedding in a sleigh!" lisped one
of the triad of bridesmaids, who were to
do double duty for the sisters. "How very
gay it makes one to hear the bells outside!
Have they come, Vic.?"</p>

<p>Victoria, whose marriage was but one
week off, was, true to instinct and habit,
on the lookout behind the friendly curtain.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes&mdash;both of them, but not
together. What a magnificent sleigh that
is of the Marlows! They brought Mr.
Hammond. See the bridegrooms shake
hands on the sidewalk! That looks so
sweet and brotherly! They will be up here
almost directly, I suppose."</p>

<p>The attendants immediately began to
shake out their robes and stroke their
white gloves. They were collected in the
sitting-room so often mentioned, and the
sisters were also present. In accordance
with the ridiculous custom of very parvenu
modern marriages, although the ceremony
was to take place precisely at twelve
o'clock, daylight was carefully excluded
from the parlors below, gas made its sickly
substitute, and the whole company was in
full evening costume.</p>

<p>"Am I all right?" inquired Lucy, with a
cautious wave of her flowing veil. "Look
at me, Vic.!"</p>

<p>"You are perfect, my dearest!" replied
the devoted parasite. "How I admire your
beautiful self-possession! And as for you,
Sarah, your calmness is wonderful! I fear
that I should be terribly agitated"&mdash;blushing,
and casting a meaning smile at Lucy.</p>

<p>Sarah's statuesque repose was broken by a
ray of scorn from the eye, and a slight disdainful
smile. Whatever were the feelings
working beneath her marble mask, she
was not reduced to the depth of wretchedness
that would humble her to accept
the insolent pity couched under the pretended
praise. She vouchsafed no other
reply; but remained standing a little apart
from the rest; her gloved hands crossed
carelessly before her; her gaze bent downwards;
her whole posture that of one who
neither waited, nor hoped, nor feared.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought that she could
be made such an elegant-looking woman?"
whispered one of the bridesmaids aside to
another.</p>

<p>"She has actually a high-bred air! I
never imagined it was in her. So much
for a Parisian toilette!"</p>

<p>"I am so much afraid that I shall lose
my color when we enter the room," said
Lucy, surveying her pink cheeks in the
mirror. "They say it is so trying to the
nerves, and I am odious when I am pale."</p>

<p>"Never fear, my sweetest. It is more
likely that the unavoidable excitement will
improve your complexion. There they
are!" returned Victoria, hurriedly, and&mdash;unconsciously,
no doubt&mdash;the three attendants
and one of the principals in the
forthcoming transaction, "struck an attitude,"
as the sound of footsteps approached
the door.</p>

<p>Lucy had only time for a whisper&mdash;a last
injunction&mdash;to her faithful crony. "Remember
to see that my veil and dress
hang right when we get downstairs." And
the masculine portion of the procession
marched in in order.</p>

<p>Sarah did not look up. She bent her head
as the formal exchange of salutations was
executed, and yielded her hand to the person
who took it in his warm pressure, and
then transferred it to his arm. It was one
of the freaks, thus denominated by her
acquaintances, in which she had been indulged,
that she desired to have her marriage
ceremony precede her sister's. She
assigned what Lucy at least considered a
sufficient reason for this caprice.</p>

<p>"Nobody will care to look at me after
you stand aside, Lucy. Keep the best wine
until the last. My only chance of getting
an approving glance lies in going in before
you attract and fix the public gaze."</p>

<p>She had her way. A limited number of
select friends were admitted to behold "the
ceremony;" yet the parlors were comfortably
filled, excepting in the magical semicircle
described by an invisible line, in the
center of which stood the clergyman in his
robes.</p>

<p>Still dull and calm, Sarah went through
the brief role that fell to her share. "Behaved
charmingly," was the unanimous
verdict of the beholders, and surprised
other people, as well as the complimentary
bridesmaid, by her thoroughbred air and
Parisian toilette. Without the pause of a
second, so perfect was the drill of the performers,
the wedded pair stepped aside,
and made way for the second happy couple.
Lucy's solicitude on the score of her complexion
was needless. As the solemn words
were commenced, a rosy blush flickered
up to its appointed resting-place&mdash;another
and another&mdash;until, when Philip released
her to the congratulatory throng, she was
the most enchanting type of a radiant Hebe
that poet ever sang, or painter burned to
immortalize on canvas.</p>

<p>Philip stood beside her and sustained his
portion of the hand-shaking and felicitations
until the press diminished, then
stepped hastily over to where Hammond
and his bride were undergoing a similar
martyrdom. Until this moment Sarah had
not looked at, or spoken to him&mdash;had never
met him face to face since their parting
in the summer at Aunt Sarah's. Now, not
aware who it was that approached her, she
raised her eyes with the serious dignity
with which she had received all other salutations,
and met his downward gaze&mdash;full
of warm and honest feeling.</p>

<p>"Sister!" he said, and in brotherly fondness
he bent towards her, and left a kiss
upon her mouth.</p>

<p>A hot glow, the lurid red of offended
modesty or self-convicted guilt, overspread
her face; the lips parted, quivered,
and closed tightly, after an ineffectual effort
to articulate; the room swam around
her, and Mr. Hammond caught her just in
time to save her from falling. It was Nature's
vengeful reaction for the long and
unnatural strain upon her energies. She
did not faint entirely away, although several
moments elapsed before she regained
perfect consciousness of her situation and
surrounding objects. She had been placed
in an easy-chair; her head rested against
her father's shoulder, and on the other
side stood Lewis, almost as pale as herself,
holding a glass of wine to her lips.
Around her were grouped her mother,
Lucy, and Philip. The guests had withdrawn
politely to the background, and
maintained a respectful silence.</p>

<p>"What have I betrayed?" was her first
coherent reflection; and, with an instinctive
perception of the quarter where such
disclosures would do most harm, her eye
turned with a sort of appealing terror to
Lewis. His heart leaped at the movement,
revealing, as he fancied it did, dependence
upon his strength, recognition of his right
to be with and nearest to her.</p>

<p>"You are better," he said, with a moved
tenderness he could not and cared not to
restrain.</p>

<p>The words, the manner, were an inexpressible
relief to her fears, and trying to
return his smile, she would have arisen
but for her father's interposition.</p>

<p>"Sit still," he advised. "Mrs. Hunt,
Lucy, Mr. Benson, will you entertain our
friends? She will be all right in a little
while, Mr. Hammond."</p>

<p>"Tableaux vivants!" said Lucy's soft,
rich voice, as she advanced towards the
reassured guests. "This is a part of the
performance not set down in the programme.
Quite theatrical, was it not?"</p>

<p>It is very possible that Philip Benson
would not have regarded this as an apropos
or refined witticism, had any one else been
the speaker; but as the round, liquid tones
rolled it forth, and her delicious laugh led
off the instant revival of mirth and badinage,
he marvelled at her consummate tact,
her happy play of fancy (!), and returned
devout thanks to the stars that had bestowed
upon him this prodigy of grace,
wit, and beauty. Sarah rallied speedily;
and, contrary to the advice of her father
and husband, maintained her post in the
drawing-room during all the reception,
which continued from half-past twelve to
half-past two.</p>

<p>It was a gay and shifting scene&mdash;a sparkling,
murmuring tide, that ebbed and
flowed to and from the quartette who
formed the attractive power. Silks, laces,
velvets, furs, and diamonds; faces young,
old, and middle-aged; handsome, fair, and
homely; all decked in the same conventional
holiday smile; bodies tall and short, executing
every variety of bow and courtesy;
voices sweet, sharp, and guttural, uttering
the senseless formula of congratulation&mdash;these
were Sarah's impressions of the tedious
ceremonial. Restored to her rigid composure,
she too bowed and spoke the word
or sentence custom exacted&mdash;an emotionless
automaton in seeming, while Lucy's
matchless inflections lent interest and
beauty to the like nothings, as she rehearsed
them in her turn; and Philip Benson,
having no solicitude for his bride's
health or ability to endure the fatigue, was
collected enough to compare the two, and,
while exulting in his selection, to commiserate
the proprietor of the colder and
less gifted sister.</p>

<p>At last the trial was over; the hospitable
mansion was closed; the parlors deserted;
the preparation for travelling hurried
through; and the daughters went forth
from their girlhood's home. Philip had
cordially invited Sarah and Lewis, by letter,
to accompany Lucy and himself to
Georgia; but Sarah would not hear of it,
and Lewis, while he left the decision to her,
was not sorry that she preferred to journey
instead with him alone. It was too cold
to go northward, and the Hammond's now
proposed to proceed with the others as far
as Baltimore, there to diverge upon a
Western and Southern tour, which was to
occupy three weeks, perhaps four.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>During the month preceding his marriage,
Lewis Hammond had spent much time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
many thoughts in providing and furnishing
a house for his wife. His coadjutor in
this labor of love was not, as one might
have expected, Mrs. Hunt, but his early
friend, Mrs. Marlow. His omission of his
future mother-in-law, in his committee of
consultation, he explained to her by representing
the number of duties already
pressing upon her, and his unwillingness to
add aught to their weight. But when both
girls were married and gone, and the work
of "getting to rights" was all over, this
indefatigable woman paid Mrs. Marlow a
visit, and offered her assistance in completing
the arrangements for the young
housekeepers.</p>

<p>"There is nothing for us to do," said Mrs.
Marlow. "Lewis attended to the purchase
of everything before leaving; and the
orders are all in the hands of a competent
upholsterer whom he has employed, as is
also the key of the house. I offered to
have the house-cleaning done, but Lewis
refused to let me help him even in this.
He is very methodical, and rather strict
in some of his ideas. When the premises
are pronounced ready for the occupancy
of the future residents, you and I will
play inspectors, and find as much fault as
we can."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt went around by the house on
her way home. It was new and handsome,
a brown stone front, with stone balconies
and balustrades; but three stories high,
it was true, yet of ample width and pitch
of ceiling, and&mdash;as she discovered by skirting
the square&mdash;at least three rooms deep
all the way up. The location was unobjectionable;
not more than four blocks
from the paternal residence, and in a wider
street. On the whole, she had no fault
to find, provided Mr. Hammond had furnished
it in such style as she would have
recommended. She had her fears lest his
sober taste in other respects should extend
to these matters, and hinted something
of the kind to her husband.</p>

<p>"I have confidence in Mr. Hammond to
believe that he will allow his wife every
indulgence compatible with his means,"
was the reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt did not deem it obligatory upon
him to state that his son-in-law had conferred
with him upon numerous questions
pertaining to Sarah's likes and probable
wishes; that he had examined and approved
of the entire collection of furniture,
etc., selected for her use. Why should he,
how could he, without engendering in his
wife's bosom the suspicion that he had
accounted to him for Lewis' choice of the
father as an adviser? namely, that the
newly-made husband had gained a pretty
correct estimate of this managing lady's
character, her penny-wise and pound-foolish
policy, and intended to inaugurate altogether
a different one in his house.</p>

<p>Regardless of Mrs. Marlow's polite insinuation
that their room was preferable to
their company until all things should be
in readiness for inspection, the ambitious
mother made sundry visits to the premises
while they were being fitted up, and delivered
herself of divers suggestions and
recommendations, which fell like sand on
a rock upon the presiding man of business.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the tourists'
return, Mrs. Marlow's carriage drew up at
Mr. Hunt's door, by appointment, to take
the mistress of the house upon the proposed
visit of criticism of her daughter's
establishment. Mrs. Marlow was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sunny mood, and indisposed to censure, as
was evinced by ejaculations of pleasure at
the general effect of each apartment as they
entered, and praise of its component parts.
Mrs. Hunt was not so undiscriminating.
The millionaire's wife must not imagine
that she was dazzled by any show of elegance,
or that she was overjoyed at the
prospect of her child's having so beautiful
and commodious a home.</p>

<p>"The everlasting oak and green!" she uttered,
as they reached the dining-room.
"It is a pity Mr. Hammond did not select
walnut and crimson instead! Green is very
unbecoming to Sarah."</p>

<p>"Then we must impress upon her the importance
of cultivating healthy roses in
her cheeks, and wearing bright warm
colors. This combination&mdash;green and oak&mdash;is
pretty and serviceable, I think. The
table is very neatly set, Mary," continued
Mrs. Marlow, kindly, to the tidy serving-maid.
"Keep an eye on the silver, my
good girl, until your mistress comes. Mrs.
Hunt, shall we peep into the china closets
before we go to the kitchen? I have taken
the liberty, at Lewis' request, of offering
to your daughter the service of a couple
of my protegees, excellent servants, who
lived for years with one of my own children&mdash;Mrs.
Morland, now in Paris. They are
honest, willing, and, I think, competent.
The man-servant, if Lewis sees fit to keep
one, he must procure himself."</p>

<p>The china, glass, and pantries were in
capital order; the kitchen well stocked,
light, and clean, and dinner over the fire.</p>

<p>"You will be punctual to the minute,
Katy, please!" was the warning here.
"Mr. Hammond is particular in the matter
of time."</p>

<p>"And you will see that my daughter has
a cup of clear, strong coffee!" ordered Mrs.
Hunt, magisterially. "She is delicate, and
accustomed to the very best of cookery."
And, having demonstrated her importance
and superior housewifery to the round-eyed
cook, she swept out.</p>

<p>To an unprejudiced eye, the whole establishment
was without a flaw; and, undisturbed
by the captious objections of her
companion in the survey, Mrs. Marlow saw
and judged for herself, and carried home
with her a most pleasing imagination of
Lewis' gratification, and Sarah's delighted
surprise with the scene that was to close
their way of cold and weariness.</p>

<p>By Mr. Hammond's expressed desire to
his father-in-law, there was no one except
the domestics in the house when they arrived.
As the carriage stopped, the listening
maid opened the door, and a stream
of radiance shot into the misty night
across the wet pavement upon the two
figures that stepped from the conveyance.</p>

<p>"In happy homes he sees the light." The
mental quotation brought back to Sarah
the vision of that lonely evening, ten
months before, when she had moaned it in
her dreary twilight musings at the window
of her little room. "Dreary then,
hopeless now!" and with this voiceless
sigh, she crossed the threshold of her destined
abode. With a kindly greeting to
the servants in the hall; Lewis hurried
his wife onward, past the parlor doors,
into a library sitting-room, back of the
show apartments, warm and bright, smiling
a very home welcome.</p>

<p>Here he placed her in a deep cushioned
chair, and, pressing her hands in his,
kissed her, with a heartfelt&mdash;"May you
be very happy in our home, dear wife!"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" she replied. "It is pleasant
here, and you are too kind."</p>

<p>"That is impossible where you are concerned.
Sit here, while I see to the trunks.
When they are carried upstairs, you can
go to your room. Throw off your hat and
cloak."</p>

<p>He was very thoughtful of her comfort&mdash;too
thoughtful, because his love made
him watchful of her every look, word, and
gesture. She was glad of the brief respite
from this vigilance, that allowed her to
bury her face in her hands and groan
aloud. She had no heart to look around
her cage. No doubt it was luxurious; the
bars softly and richly lined; the various
arrangements the best of their kind; still,
it was nothing but a cage&mdash;a prison, from
which death only could release her.</p>

<p>The trim maid came for her wrappings,
and directly afterwards Lewis, to take her
upstairs.</p>

<p>"Not a very elaborate toilet, dear," he
said, as he left her for his dressing-room.
"You will see no one this evening but our
father and mother, and they will remember
that you have been travelling all day."</p>

<p>When she was ready, it lacked still a
quarter of an hour of dinner-time, and she
acceded to Lewis' proposal that they
should go over their dwelling. By his
order, there were lights in every room.
The graceful furniture, the well-contrasted
hues of the soft carpets, the curtains and
pictures showed to fine advantage. Every
thing was in place, from cellar to attic;
not a symptom of parsimony or cheapness
in the whole; and all betokened, besides
excellent judgment, such conformity to, or
unison with her taste, that Sarah, with
all her heaviness of heart, was pleased.
She was touched too with gratitude or
remorse; for, when they were back in the
cozy sitting-room, she laid her hand timidly
on that of her husband, and said,
falteringly:</p>

<p>"I do not deserve that you should take
so much pains to gratify me, Mr. Hammond."</p>

<p>Over Lewis' face there flushed one of the
rare smiles that made him positively handsome
while they lasted. He grasped the
shrinking fingers firmly, and drew his wife
close to his side.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you how to repay me for
all that I have done, or ever can do, to
promote your ease and enjoyment?"</p>

<p>"If you please." But her heart sank, as
she foresaw some demands upon a love
that had never existed&mdash;a treasure that,
to him, was sealed and empty; yet whose
poverty she dared not avow.</p>

<p>"Call me 'Lewis,' now that we are at
home, dear. I cannot realize that you are
indeed all mine&mdash;that our lives are one and
the same, while you continue that very
proper 'Mr. Hammond.'"</p>

<p>"It comes more naturally to my tongue,
and don't you think it more respectful
than&mdash;than&mdash;the other?"</p>

<p>"I ask no such form of respect from
you. I do not fear lest you should fail to
'honor and obey' me, you little paragon
of duty! Believe me, dearest, I fully understand
and reverence the modest reserve
that has not yet ceased to be shyness, in
the expression of your sentiments towards
me. You are not demonstrative by nature.
Neither am I. But since you are
my other self, and there is no living being
nearer to you than myself, ought we not
to overcome this propensity to, or custom
of, locking up our feelings in our own
breasts? Let me begin by a confession of
one uncomfortable complaint, under which
I have labored ever since our engagement.
Do you know, darling, that I absolutely
hunger&mdash;I cannot give any other name to
the longing&mdash;I hunger and thirst to hear
you say that you love me! Do you remember
that you have never told me in so
many words what you have given me other
good reasons for believing? I need but
one thing this evening to fill my cup with
purest content. It is to have you say&mdash;openly,
fearlessly, as my wife has a right
to do&mdash;'Lewis, I love you!'"</p>

<p>"It need be a source of no unhappiness
to be married to a man whom one does
not love, provided he is kind and generous!"
say match-makers and worldly-wise
mothers. Perhaps not, after one's conscience
is seared in callosity by perjuries,
and her forehead grown bold as brass; but
the neophyte in the laudable work of
adaptation to such circumstances will trip
in her words and color awkwardly while
acquiring this enviable hardihood.</p>

<p>Sarah's head fell, and her face was
stained with blushes. One wild impulse
was to throw herself at the feet of him
whom she had wronged so foully, and,
confessing her mad, wicked deception upon
his holiest feelings, pray him to send her
away&mdash;to cast her adrift, and rid himself
of a curse, while he freed her from the
gentle, yet intolerable bondage of his love.</p>

<p>"Dinner is ready!" announced the servant.
Sarah's senses returned, and with
them self-control. With a strange smile,
she glanced up at him&mdash;a look he did not
understand, yet could not guess was born
of anguish&mdash;and said, with a hesitation
that seemed pretty and coquettish to him&mdash;"Lewis!
do you hear? May it please your
worship, I am very hungry!"</p>

<p>"Tease! I will have my revenge yet!
See if I do not!"</p>

<p>Laughing lightly, she eluded his outstretched
arm, and sprang past him into
the hall leading to the dining-room. She
assumed the seat at the table with a burlesque
of dignity, and throughout the meal
was more talkative and frolicsome than he
had ever seen her before. So captivated
was he by her lively discourse and bright
looks, that he was sorry to hear the ring,
proclaiming the coming of the expected
visitors. The dessert had not been removed,
and the girl was instructed to show
them immediately into the dining-room.</p>

<p>A toast was drunk to the prosperity of
the lately established household, and the
gentlemen went off to the library.</p>

<p>"Always see to putting away your silver,
Sarah!" counselled the mother. "And you
had ought to get a common set of dinner
and breakfast things. This china is too
nice for every-day use. Of course, Mr.
Hammond can afford to get more when
this is broken; but it's a first-rate rule,
child, as you'll find, to put your money
where it will show most. That's the secret
of my management. Mr. Hammond must
give you an allowance for housekeeping
and pin-money. Speak to him about it
right away. Men are more liberal while
the honeymoon lasts than they ever are
afterwards. Strike while the iron is hot.
You can't complain of your husband, so
far. He has set you up very handsome.
If I had been consulted about furnishing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I would have saved enough off of those
third-story chambers and the kitchen to
buy another pair of mirrors for your parlors.
The mantel has a bare look. I
noticed it directly I went in. To be sure,
the Parisian ornaments are pretty and tasty,
and expensive enough&mdash;dear knows! but
they don't make much of a display."</p>

<p>"I do not like the fashion of lining walls
with mirrors," said Sarah, in her old, short
way; "and am satisfied with the house as
it is. Shall we join the gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Nothing had ever showed her more plainly
the degradation of her false position
than the confident air her mother wore in
making her coarse observations, and instructing
her as to the method of managing
her generous, confiding husband. It
was the free-masonry of a mercenary wife,
whose spouse would have been better represented
to her mind by his money-bag
than his own proper person, towards another
of the same craft, who rated her
lawful banker by corresponding rules.</p>

<p>"Will I then really grow to be like her
and her associates?" Sarah questioned inly.
"Will a fine house and its fixtures, will dress
and equipage and pin-money so increase in
importance as to fill this aching vacuum
in my heart? Will a position in life, and the
envy of my neighbors, make up to me
for the loss of the love of which I used to
dream, the happiness which the world owes
me yet? Is this the coin in which it would
redeem its promises?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt's mild features wore their happiest
expression this evening. He arose at
the ladies' entrance, and beckoned his
daughter to a seat on the sofa beside him.</p>

<p>"You are a little travel-worn!" he said.
"Your cheeks are not very ruddy."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see them when they
were?" asked Sarah, playfully.</p>

<p>"She was always just that pale when
she was a baby," said Mrs. Hunt, setting
herself in the arm-chair proffered by her
son-in-law. "Lucy stole all the roses from
her." Sarah may have thought that other
and more grievous thefts had succeeded
this doubtful one, but she neither looked
nor said this. "And that reminds me, Mr.
H.! Did you bring Lucy's letter for Sarah
to read?"</p>

<p>"I did." Mr. Hunt produced it. "Keep
it, and read it at your leisure, Sarah."</p>

<p>"They are supremely happy, I suppose?"
remarked Lewis, with the benevolent interest
incident to his fellowship of feeling
with them.</p>

<p>"For all the world like two turtle-doves!"
Mrs. Hunt rejoined. "Their letters are a
curiosity. It is 'Phil.' and 'Lucy' from one
end to the other. I mean to save them to
show them five years from now. Hot love
is soon cool, and by-and-by they will settle
down as sensible as any of the rest of us.
You don't begin so, I see, Sarah, and I am
pleased at it. Between me and you, it's
two-thirds of it humbug! There is Victoria
West that was! She looks ready, in company,
to eat up that lean monkey of a
George Bond. I don't believe but she
shows him the other side of the picture
in private."</p>

<p>Sarah heard her father's suppressed sigh,
and felt, without looking up, that her husband's
eyes sought hers wistfully. The
unobservant dame pursued her free and
easy discourse. Mr. Hammond was "one
of the family" now, and there was no
more occasion for choice grammar or fine
sentiments before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not that I blame Victoria for taking
him. He was a good offer, and she wasn't
much admired by the gentlemen&mdash;rich as
Mr. West is. Mr. Bond is twenty-five years
older than she is, and wears false teeth
and a toupee; but I suppose she is willing
to overlook trifles. She watches out for
the main chance, and will help him take
care of his money, as well as spend it.
Vic. is a prudent girl."</p>

<p>"Lucy&mdash;Mrs. Benson&mdash;was at home when
she wrote, was she not?" interrogated Mr.
Hammond.</p>

<p>"Yes, at his father's. His mother keeps
house, and Lucy has nothing to do but
ride, visit, and entertain company. She
says the house is crowded the whole time,
and she has so many beaux that Philip
stands no chance of speaking a word to
her. She is perfectly happy."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the various feelings of
the listeners, none of them could resist
this picture of a felicitous honeymoon, so
naively spoken. Lewis' laugh cleared the
vapors from his brow, and the pain at
Sarah's heart did not hinder her from
joining in.</p>

<p>"And the ousted bridegroom, perforce,
seeks consolation in the society of his fair
friends?" said Lewis. "If this is the way
young married people show the love-sickness
you complained of just now, Mrs.
Hunt, I am content with our more staid
ways&mdash;eh, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Quiet ways suit me best," was the answer.</p>

<p>"'Still water runs deep,'" quoted Mrs.
Hunt. "I used to worry over your stay-at-home
habits and eternal study of books,
Sarah; but I'm ready to say now that you
was sensible to behave as you did, as it
has turned out. I don't mean to flatter
Mr. Hammond, but I'd ten times rather
you had taken him than a dried-up widower
like George Bond."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" bowed Lewis, desirous of
diverting attention from Sarah's growing
uneasiness beneath her mother's congratulations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt held on her way. "I never
had a fear lest Lucy shouldn't marry well.
She was pretty and attractive, and knew
too much about the world to throw herself
away for the sake of love in a cottage.
But now the danger is over, I will allow
that I used to mistrust Sarah here sometimes.
You was just queer enough to fall
in love with some adventurer with a
foreign name, and never a cent in his
pocket&mdash;yes, and marry him, too, in spite
of all that could be said and done to
prevent it. I was forever in a 'feaze'
about you; fancying that you was born to
make an out-and-out love-match&mdash;the silliest
thing a girl can do, in my opinion."</p>

<p>"You never dreamed of her 'taking up,'
as the phrase is, with a humdrum individual
like myself," said Lewis. "Nor, to be
candid, did I, for a long time, Mrs. Hunt.
Yet I cannot say that I regret her action,
disadvantageous to herself though it was.
I wrote to you of our visit to New Orleans,
did I not, sir?" he continued to Mr. Hunt,
inwardly a little disgusted by the frank
revelations his mamma-in-law was making
of her principles and plans.</p>

<p>The subject so interesting to most wedded
people, so embarrassing to one of the
present party, was not again introduced
during the elder couple's stay. When Lewis
returned to the library, after seeing them
out, Sarah sat where he had left her, her
hand shading her eyes&mdash;deep in thought, or
overcome by weariness.</p>

<p>"You had better go up to your room,
dear," said Lewis. "I wonder you are not
worn out completely."</p>

<p>She arose to obey; walked as far as the
door, then came back to him.</p>

<p>"It may appear strange to you that I
should speak openly to such a suspicion;
but I must beg you not to suppose for an
instant that in my acceptance of your
offer of marriage, I was actuated by
mercenary motives. You look surprised"&mdash;she
hurried on yet faster while her resolution
lasted&mdash;"but I could not rest without
doing myself this act of justice. Much
that mother said to-night might&mdash;must
have led you to this conclusion. I would
not have you think worse of me than I
deserve, and of this one act of baseness I
am innocent."</p>

<p>"My precious little wife, how excited you
are! and over what a nonsensical imagination!
Suspect you&mdash;the noblest as well as
the dearest of women&mdash;of selling yourself,
body and soul, for money? Listen to my
speech now, dear Sarah!"</p>

<p>He sat down and pulled her to his knee.
"I esteem you, as I love you, above all
the rest of your sex&mdash;above any other
created mortal. I know you to be a pure,
high-minded woman. When I part with
this persuasion, may I part also with
the life that doubt on this point would
render wretched! Judge, then, whether it
be possible for me to link this holy realization
of womanhood with the thought of
another character, which I will describe.
I hold that she who enters the hallowed
state of wedlock through motives of pecuniary
interest, or ambition, or convenience&mdash;indeed,
through any consideration
save that of love, single and entire, for
him to whom she pledges her vows, stands,
in the sight of her Maker and the angels,
on a level with the most abandoned outcast
that pollutes the earth she treads. I
shock you, I see; but on this subject I
feel strongly. I have seen much, too much,
of fashionable marriages formed for worldly
aggrandizement&mdash;for riches; sometimes
in pique at having lost a coveted lover.
With my peculiar sentiments, I feel that
I could endure no heavier curse than to
contract an alliance like any of these. I
repeat it, I believe in Woman as God made
her and intended she should live, if for
no other reason than because I recollect
my mother, boy as I was when she died;
and because I know and have you, my
true, blessed wife!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>A year and five months had passed away
since the evening when Lewis Hammond
held his conscience-stricken wife upon his
knee, and told her&mdash;in fervid words that
singularly belied his calm and even demeanor
at other times&mdash;of his faith in and
love for her, and his abhorrence of the
sin she felt in her trembling soul that she
had committed. Yet she had not the superhuman
courage required to contradict a
trust like this. There was no alternative
but to keep up the weary, wicked mockery.</p>

<p>"But in all these months she must have
learned to care for him!" cries Mrs. Common
Sense. "There is nothing disagreeable
about the man. He is not brilliant;
yet he has intelligence and feeling, and
is certainly attached to his wife. I have
no doubt but that he indulges her in every
reasonable request, and comports himself
in all respects like an exemplary husband."</p>

<p>Granted, to each and every head of your
description, my dear madam! But, for all
that, his obdurate wife had not come to
love him. I blush to say it; but while we
are stripping hearts let us not be squeamish!
There had been seasons, lasting
sometimes for weeks, when her existence
was a continual warfare between repugnance
to him and her sense of duty; when
she dreaded to hear his step in the hall,
and shrank inwardly from his caress;
watched and fought, until strength and
mind were well-nigh gone. Mark me! I
do not deny that this was as irrational as
it was reprehensible; but I have never held
up my poor Sarah as a model of reason or
propriety. From the beginning, I have
made her case a warning. The fates forbid
that I should commend it to any as an
example for imitation! A passionate,
proud, reticent girl; a trusting, loving, deceived
woman; a hopeless, desperate bride&mdash;whose
heart lay like a pulseless stone in
her breast at the most ardent love-words
of her husband, and throbbed with wild,
uncontrollable emotion at the fraternal
tone and kiss of her lost and only love&mdash;I
have no plea for her, save the words of
Infinite compassion and Divine knowledge
of human nature and human woe: "Let
him that is without sin among you cast
the first stone at her!"</p>

<p>The highly respectable firm of which Mr.
Hammond was the junior member, was
adding, if not field to field, thousand to
thousand, of the wherewithal for the purchase
of fields, or, what was better still,
city lots. Mrs. Lewis Hammond had set
up her carriage about a year after her
marriage; said equipage being a gift from
her generous husband on the occasion of
the first airing of the little "Baby Belle,"
as she was always called in the family.
Not until subsequent events had endowed
it with deeper and saddest interest did
Sarah read Aldrich's beautiful poem bearing
the above title. Lewis' mother's name
was Isabella. Her grandchild received the
same, which became "Belle" on the mother's
tongue, and then, because it was natural
to say "Baby" too, the pretty alliteration
was adopted.</p>

<p>To a man of Lewis' domestic tastes the
advent of this child was a source of the
liveliest pleasure, and the tiny inmate of
his household was another and a powerful
tie, binding him to a home already dear.
But to the mother's lonely life, so bare
of real comfort or joy&mdash;haunted by memory
and darkened by remorse&mdash;the precious gift
came like a ray of Heaven's purest light,
a strain of angel music, saying to care,
"Sleep!" to hope, "Awake, the morning
cometh!" Beneath the sunshine of so much
love, the infant throve finely, and without
being a greater prodigy than the nine hundred
and ninety-nine miracles of beauty
and sprightliness who, with it, composed
the thousand "blessed babies" of the day,
was still a pretty, engaging creature, whose
gurgling laugh and communicative "coo"
beguiled the mother's solitude and made
cheerful the lately silent house.</p>

<p>It was late in the June afternoon, and
arrayed in clean white frock, broad sash,
and shoulder-knots of pink ribbon, the
small lady sat on her mother's lap at the
front window, awaiting the appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the husband and father. Sarah had altered
much since her marriage; "improved wonderfully,"
said her acquaintances. There
was still in her mien a touch of haughtiness;
in her countenance the look that
spoke profound thought and introspection.
Still, when in repose, her brow had a cast
of seriousness that bordered on melancholy;
but over her features had passed a
change like that wrought by the sculptor's
last stroke to the statue. The mould was
the same&mdash;the chiselling more clear and
fine. Especially after the birth of her
child was this refining process most apparent
in its effects. There was a softness
in her smile, a gentle sweetness in her
voice, as she now talked to the babe,
directing its attention to the window, lest
the father's approach should be unnoticed,
and he disappointed in his shout of welcome.</p>

<p>"How affected! gotten up for show!"
sneered the childless Mrs. Bond, as she
rolled by in her carriage, on her way to
her handsome, cheerless home and its cross
master.</p>

<p>"She has chosen her position well, at all
events," rejoined her companion, a neighbor
and gossip, who had taken Lucy's
place in Victoria's confidence.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous!" She spat out the ejaculation
from the overflowing of her spleen.
"I could laugh at her airs, if they did
not make me mad! One would think, to
see her as she sits there, that she had
decked herself and the child to please a
man that she doted upon&mdash;like the good
wives we read of in novels."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't she be fond of him?
He is a good-hearted fellow, and lets her
do pretty much as she pleases, I imagine,
besides waiting on her like any lover. I
often meet them riding out together. That
is more than your husband or mine ever
does, my dear."</p>

<p>"They go quite as often as we desire
their company, I fancy. Mine does, I
know. Perhaps if we had the reason for
parading our conjugal devotion that Mrs.
Hammond has, we might wheedle our lawful
lords into taking a seat alongside of
us once in a while. There's nothing like
keeping up appearances, particularly if
the reality is lacking. If Lewis Hammond
knew some of the pretty stories I could
tell him about Sarah's love-scrapes, he
would not look so sublimely contented with
his three-story paradise. The elegant
clothes he piles upon that squaw of his are
preposterous, and she carries them off as
if she had dressed well all her days. I tell
you, she never looked decent until she
put on her wedding-dress. You have heard
of the fainting-scene that took place that
morning, I suppose? Old Mother Hunt
said it was 'sensibility,' and 'nervous agitation;'
the company laid it to the heat of
the room; and I laughed in my sleeve, and
said nothing. If that woman aggravates
me much more, I will remind her of some
passages in her experience she does not
dream that I know."</p>

<p>"Do tell me what you mean? I am dying
of curiosity! Did she flirt very hard before
she was married?"</p>

<p>"She never had the chance. Lewis Hammond
was her only offer."</p>

<p>"What was the matter, then?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you now. It is too long a
story. The next time she frets me, as she
does whenever she crosses my path, maybe
you will hear the romance. Shall I set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
you down at your door, or will you enliven
me by spending the evening with me? I
do not expect other company, and George
falls asleep over his newspaper as soon as
he has despatched his dinner. Come in,
and I will show you the loveliest sofa-pillow
you ever beheld; a new pattern I
have just finished."</p>

<p>"Thank you! I would accept the invitation
with pleasure, but I have not been
home since breakfast, and James makes
such a fuss if he does not find me in the
nursery, tending that whimpering baby,
when he comes up at night, that it is as
much as my life is worth to stay out after
six o'clock. Anything for peace, you know;
and since we wives are slaves, it is best
to keep on the blind side of our masters."</p>

<p>The day had been warm down town, and
as Lewis Hammond stepped from the stage
at the corner nearest his house, he felt
jaded and dispirited&mdash;a physical depression,
augmented by a slight headache. A business
question which he had talked over
with Mr. Marlow, before leaving the store,
contributed its weight of thoughtfulness,
and he was not conscious how near he
was to his dwelling until, aroused by a
sharp tap upon the window-pane, he
glanced up at the animated tableau framed
by the sash&mdash;the smiling mother, and the
babe leaping and laughing, and stretching
its hands towards him.</p>

<p>"This is the sweetest refreshment a man
can ask after his day of toil," he said,
when, having kissed his wife and child, he
took the latter in his arms. He was not
addicted to complimentary speeches, and
while his esteem and attachment for his
chosen partner were even stronger than
they had been in the heart of the month-old
bridegroom, he was less apt to express
them to her now than then. In one respect,
and only one, his wedded life had
brought him disappointment. Unreserved
confidence and demonstrative affection on
his side failed to draw forth similar exhibitions
of feeling from Sarah. Kind,
thoughtful, dutiful, scrupulously faithful
to him and his interests in word, look,
and deed, she ever was. Yet he saw that
she was a changed being from the fond,
impulsive daughter, whose ministry in her
father's sick-room had won for her a husband's
love. Her reception of his affectionate
advances was passive&mdash;a reception
merely, without apparent return. Never,
and he had ceased now to ask it, had she
once said to him the phrase he had craved
to hear&mdash;"I love you!" Yet he would as
soon have questioned the reality of his existence
as that she did love him. He held
inviolate his trust in the motive that had
induced her to become his wife, and in
this calm confidence he was fain to rest,
in the absence of protestations that would
have gladdened his soul, while they could
hardly have strengthened his faith in her
affection.</p>

<p>Few wives, however loving, have been
more truly cherished than was Sarah, and
of this she was partially aware. If she
had remained ignorant of Lewis' sentiments
and wishes with regard to herself,
until the grieved and unrequited love had
subsided into the dull aching that does not,
like a green wound, create, by its very
smart, a species of excitement that helps
one bear the pain; had he glided gradually
into the joyless routine of her life's duties,
and abided his time of speaking until he
had made himself necessary to her comfort
and peace, he might have won a willing
bride. But what omniscient spirit was
there to instruct and caution him? He met
and loved her, supposing her to be as free
as himself; like an honest, upright man,
he told that love, and, without a misgiving
placed his honor and his happiness
in her hands.</p>

<p>Sarah could not have told why she revolved
all this in her unquiet mind as he
sat near her, playing with their child; yet
she did think of their strange sad history,
and from the review arose a feeling of
pity, sincere, almost tender for him, so
worthy and so deceived. She remembered
with abasement of spirit how often she
had been ready to hate him as the instrument
of her bondage; how wrathful
words had arisen to her lips at the moment
of his greatest kindness; how patiently
he had borne her coldness; how
unflagging was his care of and for her.
Over the dark, turbulent gulf of the unforgotten
past that sundered their hearts,
she longed, as she had never done before,
to call to him, and confessing her sin
against Heaven and against him, to implore
pardon for the sake of the spotless
babe that smiled into the father's face
with its mother's eyes. Would he be
merciful? Slowly and emphatically memory
repeated in her ear his denunciation of
the unloving wife, and courage died before
the menaced curse.</p>

<p>"Fudge! Fiddlesticks! what frippery nonsense!"
cry out, in a vehement storm of
indignation, a bevy of the Common Sense
connection. "Are we not staid and respectable
matrons all? Do we not rear our
daughters virtuously, and teach our sons
to honor father as well as mother? Yet
who of us troubles herself with raking in
the cold ashes of her 'long ago' for the
bones of some dead and gone love&mdash;a girlish
folly of which she would be ashamed now?
What cares Mr. Common Sense, among his
day-books and ledgers, in his study or in
his office, how many times his now correct
helpmeet pledged eternal fidelity to other
lovers before she put her last crop of wild
oats into the ground, and settled for life
with him? What if some of us, may be
all, if driven hard, should admit that when
we stood up before the minister we underwent
certain qualms&mdash;call them pangs,
if you like&mdash;at the thought of Tom This,
or Harry That, or Dick The Other, who,
if circumstances had permitted, we would
have preferred should occupy the place of
'The man whom we actually held by the
hand!' While men can choose their mates,
and women can only take such as propose
to them, these things will happen. After
all, who is hurt? You aver that none of
you are, mesdames, and we would not
call your word in question. Ladies so
conscientious must, of necessity, be veracious,
even in love affairs."</p>

<p>"I am a thoughtless animal!" said Lewis
at the dinner-table. "There is a letter
from Lucy! Open it&mdash;don't mind me! I
will crack your nuts for you while you
read it."</p>

<p>There was a troubled look in Sarah's
eye when she laid it down. "Lucy says
they are certainly coming North this year&mdash;that
we may look for them in a week
from the date of this. This is rather
sooner than mother expected them. Her
housecleaning is late this season, in consequence
of her rheumatic spell in May."</p>

<p>"Let them come straight here! What
should prevent them? There is an abundance
of room for them&mdash;baby, nurse, and
all. It will be a grand arrangement!" said
Lewis, heartily.</p>

<p>Sarah was backward in replying. "Father
and mother may object. I would not
wound them by interference with their
guests."</p>

<p>"I will answer that mother will thank
us to take care of them until her scrubbing
and scalding are done. And Lucy would
not be willing to risk her baby's health in
a damp house."</p>

<p>"I will go and see mother to-morrow
about it," concluded Sarah. She still appeared
dubious as to the expediency of the
proposed step, a thoughtfulness that did
not wear away during the whole evening.</p>

<p>The Bensons had not visited New York
the preceding year. They were detained at
the South by a combination of causes, the
principal of which was the long and fatal
illness of Philip's mother. Lucy had written
repeatedly of her intense desire to see
her home once more, declaiming against
the providences that had thwarted their
projects, like an impatient, unreasonable
child.</p>

<p>"Philip says it is not convenient for him
to go just yet," said her letter to her sister,
"and that our part of the country is
as healthy as Saratoga itself; but I have
vowed that I will not wait one day beyond
the time I have set. It sets me wild
to think of being in Broadway again&mdash;of
visiting and shopping, and seeing you all.
We have been so dull here since Mrs. Benson's
death, and Philip is as solemn as a
judge. One of his married sisters will stay
with the old gentleman while we are away.
O Sarah, I am sick of housekeeping and
baby-nursing! It will do well enough for
me when I need spectacles and a wig;
but now, while I am young enough to
enjoy life, it is insufferable!"</p>

<p>"Not very domestic, is she?" observed
Lewis, folding up the letter, which Sarah
had handed him. "Ah! it is not every
man who has such a gem of a wife as I
have! It appears to me that the married
women of these days are not satisfied unless
they have a string of beaux as long
as that of a popular single belle. How is
it, little one? Do you ever catch yourself
wishing that your husband were not
such an old-fashioned piece of constancy,
and would give some other fellow a chance
to say a pretty thing, when you are in
company?"</p>

<p>"I do not complain," said Sarah, demurely.</p>

<p>"Not in words, perhaps; your patience is
wonderful in everything. But how do you
feel when you see your old neighbor, Mrs.
Bond, waltzing every set with the gayest
gallant in the ball-room, while your jailor
does not like to have you 'polk' at all, and
favors your dancing only with men whom
he knows to be respectable?"</p>

<p>"I feel that Mr. Hammond is a sensible
man, and careful of his wife's reputation,
even in trifles, while Mr. Bond"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on! finish your sentence!"</p>

<p>"And his lady are a well-matched pair!"</p>

<p>Much as she disliked Victoria, and knowing
that she was hated still by her, Sarah
deemed it a necessary and common act
of courtesy to her sister's friend to call
and apprise her of Lucy's probable visit.</p>

<p>"It is not convenient for mother to receive
them for a week yet, on account of
certain household arrangements," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
stated, in making known the object of her
visit to her ancient enemy. "So you will
find Lucy at our house, where her friends
will be received as if they were my own."</p>

<p>"You are very polite, I am sure!" replied
Mrs. Bond, smothering her displeasure at
Sarah's studied civility, and noting, with
her quick, reptile perceptions, that she was
to be tolerated as she fancied Sarah would
imply, merely as Lucy's early associate.
"And the Bensons are to be with you! I
shall call immediately upon their arrival.
Poor, dear Lucy! I long to see her. She
has had a vast deal of trouble since her
marriage&mdash;has she not?"</p>

<p>"Except the death of her mother-in-law,
she has had nothing to trouble her that I
have heard of," answered Sarah, rising to
go.</p>

<p>"My dear creature! what do you call
the wear and tear of managing a husband,
and a pack of unruly servants, and looking
after a baby? And she was such a belle!
I wonder if she is much broken!"</p>

<p>"Come and see!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hammond was at the parlor door.</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;most assuredly! How do you
like their being quartered upon you? What
does that pattern husband of yours say to
this?"</p>

<p>"Madam!" said Sarah, surprised and offended
by the rude query.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't mean that it would not be
very delightful to you to have your sister
with you; but there was a foolish rumor,
about the time of your marriage, that you
and Mr. Benson had some kind of a love-passage
down in the country; and I
thought that Mr. Hammond, with his particularly
nice notions, might retain an unpleasant
recollection of the story, which
would prevent him from being on brotherly
terms with his old rival. Men are terribly
unreasonable mortals, and perfect Turks
in jealousy! We cannot be too careful not
to provoke their suspicions."</p>

<p>Not for the universe would Sarah have
betrayed any feeling at this insolence, save
a righteous and dignified resentment at its
base insinuations; but the ungovernable
blood streamed in crimson violence to her
temples, and her voice shook when she
would have held it firm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hammond is not one to be influenced
by malicious gossip, Mrs. Bond, if,
indeed, the report you have taken the liberty
of repeating was ever circulated except
by its author. I cannot thank you for
your warning, as I recognize no occasion
for jealousy in my conduct or character.
I am accountable for my actions to my
conscience and my husband, and I release
you from what you have assumed to be
your duty of watching and criticising my
personal affairs. Good-morning."</p>

<p>"I struck a sore spot! no doubt of that!"
soliloquized Mrs. Bond, recalling Sarah's
start of pain and blush at the indelicate
allusion to Philip Benson. "That woman
stirs up all the bile in my system if I talk
two minutes with her. If there were half
the material to work upon in that vain,
weak Lucy, that there is in this sister, I
would have my revenge. As for Lewis
Hammond, he is a love-sick fool!"</p>

<p>Sarah's cheeks had not lost their flush,
nor had her heart ceased its angry throbbings,
when she reached home. In the
solitude of her chamber, she summoned
strength and resolution to ask herself the
question, so long avoided, shunned, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
had imagined, in prudence, as she now
began to fear, in dread of a truthful reply.</p>

<p>When she married Lewis Hammond, she
loved another. Fearful as was this sin, it
would be yet more terrible were she now to
discover a lurking fondness, an unconquered
weakness for that other, in the
heart of the trusted wife, the mother who,
from that guilty bosom, nourished the
little being that was, as yet, the embodiment
of unsullied purity. It was a trying
and a perilous task, to unfold deliberately,
to pry searchingly into the record of that
one short month that had held all the
bloom and fragrance of her life's spring
season; to linger over souvenirs and compare
sensations&mdash;a painful and revolting
process; but, alas! the revulsion was not
at memories of that olden time; and as
this appalling conviction dawned upon her,
her heart died within her.</p>

<p>The nurse was arranging Baby Belle for
the possible reception of her unknown aunt
and uncle, that afternoon, when Mrs.
Hammond came into the nursery, her face
as pale and set as marble, and silently
lifted the child from the girl's lap to her
own. For one instant her cheek was laid
against the velvet of the babe's; the ringlets
of fair hair mingled with her dark
locks, before she set about completing its
unfinished toilette. With a nicety and
care that would have seemed overstrained,
had other than mother's hands been busied
in the work, the stockings and slippers
were fitted on the plump feet; the sunny
curls rolled around the fingers of the
tiring woman, and brushed back from the
brow; the worked cambric robe lowered
cautiously over the head, lest the effect
of the coiffure should be marred; the
sleeves looped up with bands of coral and
gold, a necklace, belonging to the same
set, clasped around the baby's white throat,
and she was ready for survey.</p>

<p>"Now, Baby Belle and mamma will go
down to meet papa!"</p>

<p>And with the little one still clinging to
her neck, she met, in the lower hall, her
husband ushering in Lucy and Philip Benson.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>Breakfast was kept back an hour next
morning to await Lucy's tardy appearance.
"She was sadly wearied with her journey,"
apologized Philip, and Sarah begged that
she would keep her room and have her
meals sent up to her&mdash;an hospitable offer,
which Mr. Benson negatived.</p>

<p>Lucy did look tired and unrefreshed, and,
to speak more plainly, very cross. Her
hair, in its dryest state of pale yellow, was
combed straight back above her temples;
her skin was sallow; her wrapper carelessly
put on, and its dead white unrelieved
by even a bow of ribbon at the throat.
Involuntarily Lewis glanced from the uninviting
picture to his household deity, in
her neat breakfast-dress of gray silk faced
with pink, her glossy hair and tranquil
features, and said to himself, in secret
triumph, "Which is now the beauty? None
of your trumpery ornamental articles for
me!"</p>

<p>Philip's eyes were as keen as his host's,
and the probability is that he instituted
a similar comparison, however well his
pride succeeded in concealing the act and
its result. Cutting short his wife's querulous
plaints of the discomforts of travel,
and the horrors of nervous sleeplessness,
he opened a conversation with Mr. Hammond
in the subdued, perfectly-managed
tones Sarah remembered so well, selecting
such topics as would interest a business
man and a citizen of a commercial metropolis.
Lucy pouted, and applied herself
for consolation to her breakfast.</p>

<p>With a strange mingling of emotions,
Sarah listened to the dialogue between the
gentlemen. She was anxious that Lewis
should acquit himself creditably. Brilliant,
like Philip, he could never be; but in sterling
sense, not many men were his superiors.
She had never had cause to be
ashamed of him; for one so unpretending
and judicious was not liable to make himself
ridiculous. Whence, then, the solicitude
with which she hung upon his every
word? her disappointment when he did not
equal the ideal reply she had fashioned, as
she heard the words that called it forth?
Several times she joined in the conversation,
invariably to corroborate Lewis' assertions,
or to supply something he had
omitted to state. Philip Benson was a
student of human nature. Was his mind
sufficiently abstracted from his domestic
annoyances to divine the motive that Sarah
herself only perceived afterwards in solitary
self-examination? Not love of, or admiration
for the intrinsic excellence of the
man whose name she bore; not fear lest
his modesty should lessen his merits in
the eyes of others; but a selfish dread that
his acute interlocutor, discerning in him
nothing likely to attract or win the affection
of a woman such as he knew her to
be, might guess her true reason for marrying
Mr. Hammond. The timorous progeny
of one guilty secret can only be numbered
by the minutes during which it is borne
in the bosom. Like the fabled Laced&aelig;monian
boy, Sarah carried the gnawing
horror with a fortitude that looked like
cheerfulness. Habit cannot lighten the
weight of a clinging curse; but strength
and hardness come in time, if the burdened
one is not early crushed by his load.</p>

<p>The sisters spent most of the day in
Lucy's room; the latter stretched upon the
lounge, as she declared, "completely used
up." Mrs. Hunt came around early in the
forenoon, and into her sympathizing ears
the spoiled child poured the story of her
woes and wrongs; Sarah sitting by with
a swelling, rebellious heart. With indecorous
contempt for one of the most binding
laws of married state&mdash;inviolable
secrecy as to the faults of the other party
to the momentous compact&mdash;mother and
daughter compared notes upon their husbands,
and criticised the class generally as
the most wrong-headed, perverse, and dictatorial
of all the necessary evils of society.</p>

<p>Mrs. Benson, the elder, and her pleasure-loving
daughter-in-law had differed seriously
several months before the death of
the former. Philip, while espousing his
wife's cause to the rest of his family, had,
in private, taken her to task for what he
considered objectionable in her conduct;
her heads of offence being mainly extravagant
love of gay company, and the gallant
attentions of gentleman visitors; neglect of
dress and all efforts to please, when there
was no company by; and a decided indisposition
to share in the household duties,
which his mother's increasing feebleness
made onerous to her.</p>

<p>"Ah, mother!" sighed the interesting
complainant, raising herself to shake up
her pillow, then sinking again upon it.
"If girls only realized what is before them
when they marry, few would be brave
enough to change their condition. When I
picture to myself what I was at home&mdash;a
petted darling&mdash;never allowed to inconvenience
myself when it could possibly be
avoided; courted in society; free as air
and light-hearted as a child; and then
think of all that I have endured from the
unkindness of strangers, and the&mdash;well&mdash;the
want of sympathy in him for whom I
had given up my dear old home and friends&mdash;I
ask myself why I did not remain single!"</p>

<p>The prudent matchmaker shook her head.
"Marriage is a lottery, they say, my dear;
but I am very sure that single life is a
blank. You had no fortune, and in the
event of your father's death would have
been almost destitute. I am sorry your
father did not insist upon Mr. Benson's
giving you your own establishment at
once. I hope, now the old lady is out of
the way, you will have things more according
to your notions."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe that! As if there were
not two sisters-in-law, living but four
miles off, and driving over every other day
to 'see how pa is.' That means, to see
whether Lucy is letting things go to
wreck and ruin. I understand their spiteful
ways! Philip shuts his ears when I
talk about them; but I am determined that
I will not bear much more meddling!"</p>

<p>Decidedly, Lucy Benson married was a
woeful declension from the seraphic spinster
depicted in our earlier chapters; but,
as in time past, so in time present and to
come, the sparkling sugar, whose integrity
and sweetness appeared indestructible,
while it was kept dry and cool, if dampened,
undergoes an acetous fermentation,
and the delicate sweet-meat, exposed to
the air at a high temperature, becomes
speedily a frothing mass, evolving pungent
gases. The pretty doll who anticipates, in
the connubial state, one long fete-day of
adoration received, and benign condescension
dispensed, is as certain to awake from
this dream as from any other, and upon
the temper in which she sustains the disenchantment,
depends a vast proportion
of her future welfare and peace.</p>

<p>Lucy's behavior to her babe was a mixture
of childish fondling and neglect. Fortunately,
the little "Hunt's" special attendant
was an elderly woman, long established
as "Maumer" in the Benson family,
and her devotion to her charge prevented
any present evil effects from his mother's
incompetence or carelessness. Philip's
pride in, and love for his boy were extreme.
When he came in that evening,
Sarah chanced to be in the nursery adjoining
her chamber, watching and inciting
the two babies to a game of romps.
She held one on each knee, the nurses
standing by in amused gratification.</p>

<p>"That is surely my little man's voice!"
said Philip, as he and Lewis came up the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Let me see!"&mdash;and Mr. Hammond peeped
into the playroom. "Walk in!" he continued,
throwing the door wide open.
"Isn't there a pair of them?"</p>

<p>"And a nurse worthy of the twain!"
returned Philip. He stooped to the invitation
of the lifted arms, fluttering, as if
the owner would fly to his embrace. "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
do you say of him, aunty? Is he not a
passable boy?"</p>

<p>"More than passable! he is a noble-looking
fellow. He resembles you, I think,"
said Sarah, quietly.</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Hammond? Your
wife pronounces me 'more than passable&mdash;a
noble-looking fellow!' So much for an
adroit hint. Is she given to flattery?"</p>

<p>"Not she!" returned Lewis, laughing.
"She never said as much as that for my
looks in all her life. I have one consolation,
however; the less she says the more
she means!" He went into the dressing-room,
and Philip, still holding the child,
seated himself by Sarah.</p>

<p>"How odd, yet how familiar it seems, to
be with you once more, my good sister!
What a succession of mischances has made
us virtual strangers for many months past!
I had almost despaired of ever holding
friendly converse with you again. I wonder
if your recollections of our visit to
Aunt Sarah are as vivid as mine. Do you
remember that last sad, yet dear day on
the Deal Beach?"</p>

<p>Baby Belle was standing in her mother's
lap, her soft, warm arms about her neck;
and around the frail, sinking human heart
invisible arms, as warm and close, were
upholding and strengthening it in the
moment of mortal weakness.</p>

<p>"Very distinctly. Many changes have
come to us both since then."</p>

<p>"To me very many! I have grown older
in heart than in years." Then, evidently
fearing that she might otherwise interpret
his meaning, he subjoined: "We have had
a heavy bereavement in our household,
you know. Your changes have all been
happy ones. The enthusiastic, restless girl
has ripened into the more sedate, yet more
blessed wife and mother."</p>

<p>Press your sweet mouth to the convulsed
lips, Baby Belle! Veil with your silky curls
the tell-tale features, whose agitation
would bewilder, if not betray! Philip was
stroking the head of his boy, and did not
see the uneasiness of his companion.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of Uncle Nathan's
death?" she asked, clearing her throat.</p>

<p>He looked surprised at the inquiry. "Yes!
Aunt Sarah wrote immediately to my
father."</p>

<p>"Ah! I had forgotten that they were
brothers. My memory is treacherous. Excuse
me! I am wanted in the dining-room!"</p>

<p>Lewis met her just outside the door,
and stopped her to bestow the evening kiss
he had not cared to offer in Philip's presence.</p>

<p>"Why, you are as rosy as a peony!" he
said, jestingly. "Has Benson been paying
you compliments, in return for yours to
him? I must look after you two, if you
carry on at this rate."</p>

<p>With a look he had reason subsequently
to recall, but which only pleased him at
the time, she raised his hand to her lips&mdash;a
look of humility, gratitude, and appeal,
such as one might cast upon a slighted
benefactor&mdash;and vanished.</p>

<p>A merry family party gather around the
Hammond's generous table, that afternoon.
All the Hunts were there&mdash;from the father
down to Jeannie, who was fast shooting
up into a tall girl, somewhat pert in manner,
but lovable despite this, at times, unpleasant
foible.</p>

<p>"Sister Lucy," she said, after an interval
of silence, "Ellen West said, at school, to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that you were a great belle when you
were a young lady; were you?"</p>

<p>"You must not ask me, Jeannie!" The
old smile of conscious beauty stole into
Lucy's cheeks.</p>

<p>"Was she, sister?" Jeannie referred the
case to Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, she was very beautiful,"
replied the latter, simply.</p>

<p>"She isn't now&mdash;not so very handsome, I
mean&mdash;no handsomer than you are, sister!"</p>

<p>"Jeannie! you forget yourself!" interposed
Mrs. Hunt.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma, I did not intend to be
rude! Only I thought that belles were always
the prettiest ladies that could be
found anywhere."</p>

<p>"By no means!" corrected Lewis, willing
to help his wife's pet out of a scrape.
"There are many descriptions of belles,
Jeannie: handsome, rich, fast, and intellectual."</p>

<p>"And as papa was not rich, I suppose
you were either fast or intellectual, sister
Lucy!" persisted the child.</p>

<p>"I thought her pretty fast when I tried to
catch her," said Philip.&mdash;"Mrs. Hunt, Mrs.
Hammond, Mrs. Benson, have you ladies
decided in the course of to-day's congress
what watering-place is to be made the
fashion by our clique next month?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt replied that they inclined to
Newport; principally on account of Lucy
and the children, who would all be benefited
by the bathing.</p>

<p>Lucy was sure that she should tire of
Saratoga or the Catskills in a week,
whereas she adored the ocean.</p>

<p>"What says Madame Discretion?" said
Lewis, merrily, to his wife.</p>

<p>"Except that it would break up the family
party, I had rather stay at home as
long as it is prudent to keep the baby
in town; then, if you could go with us,
spend a month at some mountain farmhouse
or seaside cottage," she answered.</p>

<p>"Hear! hear!" commanded Philip. "Behold
a modern wedded dame who prefers
seclusion with her liege lord to gayety
without him! The age of miracles is returning!"</p>

<p>"Is the case, then, so anomalous?" retorted
Sarah, the red spot in her cheek
alone testifying to her embarrassment.
"Are your Southern matrons all public
characters?"</p>

<p>"I can answer that!" said Lucy. "They
are slaves! housekeeping machines&mdash;nothing
better!"</p>

<p>"How many more weak places are there
in this crust of family chit-chat, I should
like to be informed!" thought the annoyed
and uninitiated Hammond. "Here goes for
the spot where there is no danger of anybody's
breaking in!" He spoke aloud. "A
tempting proposal was made to me this
morning. It is considered advisable for one
of our firm to go abroad for a couple of
months, perhaps longer, to divide his time
among the principal manufacturing districts
of England, Scotland, and France.
Expenses paid by the firm, and the term
of absence indefinitely prolonged, if the
traveler wishes it. Mr. Marlow is tired
of crossing the ocean, and presses me to
accept the mission."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him?"</p>

<p>It was Sarah who spoke in a startled
voice that drew general notice to her
alarmed face. Her concern was a delicious
tribute to her husband's self-love, if he
possessed such a quality. At least he
loved her well enough to be pleased at her
manifest reluctance to have him leave her.</p>

<p>"I told him that I must ask my wife,"
said he in a meek tone, belied by the
humorous twinkle in his eye, and loving
half-smile about his mouth. "See what it
is to be one under authority, Benson! A
man dare not conclude an ordinary business
transaction without the approval of
the powers that be."</p>

<p>When Sarah accompanied her sister to
her chamber that night, the passee belle
put a direct question.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Sarah, are you as much in
love with Mr. Hammond as you seem to
be, or is it all put on for the benefit of
outsiders?"</p>

<p>"I am not apt to do anything for the
sake of mere show; nor do I care for the
opinion of 'outsiders,' as you call them,"
rejoined Sarah, amazed at the cool audacity
of the inquiry, and disposed to resent
Lucy's confident expectation that she
would avow the cheat, if such there were,
in her deportment.</p>

<p>"You used to be shockingly independent,
I know. What a ridiculously honest little
puss you were! How you despised all our
pretty arts and necessary affectations!
How you hated our economical mother's
second-best furniture and dinners! I don't
believe Victoria West has ever forgiven
you for the way in which you used to
take to pieces what you styled our 'surface
talk and surface life!' I thought, however,
that you had discovered by this time, that
one cannot live in the world without deceiving
herself or other people; I prefer
making fools to being one. Heigh-ho! this
life is a very unsatisfactory business at the
best. What a heavenly collar that is of
yours! One thing I do wish, and that is&mdash;that
my husband were half as fond of
me, or as good to me, as Lewis is to you!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>Lewis Hammond had thrown the whole
weight of his influence in the family conclave
into the Newport scale; and to this
popular resort Sarah went, in July, in
company with the Bensons, her mother
and Jeannie, who was made one of the
party at Lewis' request and expense. The
generous fellow acted in conformity with
conscience and judgment in this temporary
exile of his treasures; and, consistent in
his purpose of rendering it a pleasure excursion
to his wife, he made very light
of his prospects of lonely widowerhood,
representing, instead, the benefit she and
the babe would draw from the sea-breezes,
and his enhanced enjoyment of his weekly
visits, because they were so far apart. He
went with them to the shore, at their general
flitting, and spent two days; saw for
himself that those whose comfort was
nearest his heart were properly accommodated;
privately feed chambermaid and waiter,
with hints of future emolument to accrue
to them from special regard to the
wants of Mrs. Hammond and her infant,
and returned to town with the unenviable
consciousness of having left at least three-fourths
of himself behind him.</p>

<p>A brisk rush of business beguiled him of
the aching, hollow void for a few hours
after he got back. Not even Baby Belle's
accents could be heard amid that roar
and whir. But at luncheon-time, while
waiting for his order to be filled at a
restaurant, the dreary, solitary void overtook
him&mdash;a fit of unmistakable home-sickness,
that yet caused him to recoil at the
idea of entering the deserted house uptown,
when evening should oblige him to
seek a lodging. How were Sarah and baby
getting along without him? He was afraid
that Lucy was not, in all respects, as congenial
a companion as he could have
wished his wife to have, and that Mrs.
Hunt's undisguised worldliness, her foolish
love of fashion and display, would
often annoy and mortify her sensible and
right-judging daughter. Benson was capital
company, though&mdash;a gentleman every
inch of him! and very friendly to Sarah.
But for her reserved manners he would
act the part of a real brother to her; in
any case, he would be kind, and see that
she wanted for nothing.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;shot into his head by some unseen
and unaccountable machinery&mdash;there darted
across his mind a fragment of a conversation
he had overheard, at entering his
parlor, the day before the Bensons left.
Philip and Lucy were standing before a
miniature painting of Sarah and her child,
completed and brought home a short time
previous. Although seemingly intent upon
the picture, their conversation must have
strayed far from the starting-point, for
the first sentence that reached the unintentional
listener was a tart, scornful
speech from Lucy, that could by no stretch
of the imagination be made to apply to
her sister.</p>

<p>"If you admire her so much, why did
you not marry her when you had the opportunity?
She was willing enough!"</p>

<p>"Take care you do not make me regret
that I did not do so!" was Philip's stern
rejoinder as he turned from her.</p>

<p>The change of position showed him that
Lewis was present, and for a second his
inimitable self-possession wavered. Recovering
himself, he reverted to the picture,
and called upon his host to decide some
disputed point in its artistic execution
which he and Lucy were discussing.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! he has learned that all
is not gold that glitters!" mused Lewis to
the newspaper he was pretending to read.
"Lucy had a high reputation for amiability
before she was Mrs. Benson. There is no
touchstone like the wedding ring to bring
out one's true qualities."</p>

<p>He sat with his back to the entrance of
the saloon, and the table directly behind
him was now taken possession of by three
or four new arrivals&mdash;all gentlemen, and
apparently on familiar terms with one another.
They called for a bountiful lunch,
including wine, and plunged into a lively,
rather noisy talk. Lewis closed his ears,
and applied himself in earnest to his paper.
He started presently at a word he
could have declared was his name. Restraining
the impulse to look around and
see who of the group was known to him,
he yet could not help trying to determine
this point by their voices. One, a thin
falsetto, he fancied belonged to George
Bond, who was no more of a favorite with
him than was his better half with Sarah.
Lewis regarded him as a conceited rattlepate,
whose sole talent lay in the art of
making money&mdash;whose glory was his purse.
"Why should he be talking about me here?
Nonsense; I was mistaken!" and another
page of the newspaper was turned.</p>

<p>"When I leave my wife at Newport, or
anywhere else, in the particular and brotherly
care of one of her former flames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
publish me as a crazy fool!" said the wiry
voice again, almost in the reader's ear.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know old stories as well as
you do, perhaps," remarked some one.</p>

<p>"I should think not! When my wife
pulls the wool over my eyes in that style,
horsewhip me around town, and I won't
cry 'Quarter!' Sister's husband or not,
I'll be hanged if I would have him in my
house for two weeks, and he is such a
good-looking dog, too!"</p>

<p>He stopped, as if his neighbor had jogged
him, as Lewis looked over his shoulder
in the direction of the gossip. A dead and
awkward silence ensued, ended at last
by the pertinent observation that the
"waiter was a long time bringing their
lunch."</p>

<p>In a maze of angry doubt and incredulity
as to the evidence of his senses and suspicions,
Lewis finished his meal, and
stalked out past the subdued and now voracious
quartette, favoring them with a
searching look as he went by, which they
sustained with great meekness. All the
afternoon a heavy load lay upon his heart,
an indefinable dread he dared not analyze;
a foreboding he would not face, yet could
not dismiss.</p>

<p>"You are blue, Lewis," said Mr. Marlow,
kindly, as they started uptown together.
"This is the worst of having a wife and
children; you miss them so terribly when
they are away. But you will get used to
it. Make up your mind at the eleventh
hour to cross the water, and stay abroad
three months. You will be surprised to
find how easy your mind will become after
a couple of weeks."</p>

<p>"I am satisfied, sir, without making personal
trial of the matter, that men become
inured to misery, which seemed in the beginning
to be insupportable."</p>

<p>Mr. Marlow laughed, and they separated.</p>

<p>Lewis sighed as he looked up at the
blinds of his house, shut fast and grim, and
still more deeply as he admitted himself
to the front hall, that echoed dismally the
sound of the closing door. His next movement
was to walk into the parlor, throw
open a shutter, and let in the evening light
upon the portraits of the dear absent ones.
There he stood, scanning their faces&mdash;eyes
and soul full of love and longing&mdash;until the
mellow glow passed away and left them in
darkness.</p>

<p>The comfortless evening repast was over,
and he betook himself to the library, Sarah's
favorite room, as it was also his. Her
low easy-chair stood in its usual place opposite
his at the center-table, but her workbasket
was missing; likewise the book with
its silver marker, that he was wont to see
lying side by side with some volume he had
selected for his own reading. But one lay
there now, and there was an odd choking
in his throat as he read the title on the
back. He had expressed a wish for it in
Sarah's hearing some days before, and her
delicate forethought had left it here as a
solace and keepsake, one that should, while
reminding him of her, yet charm away sad
feelings in her absence. Even in the exterior
of the gift, she had been regardful
of his taste. The binding was solid and
rich; no gaudy coloring or tawdry gilt; the
thick smooth paper and clear type were a
luxury to touch and sight. Lewis was no
sentimentalist in the ordinary acceptation
of the term, yet he kissed the name his
wife had traced upon the fly-leaf ere he sat
down to employ the evening as she by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gift tacitly requested him to do. But it
was a useless attempt. The book was not
in fault, and he should have read it intently
if only because she had bestowed it;
still the hand that held it sank lower and
lower, until it rested upon his knee, and
the reader was the thinker instead.</p>

<p>The most prosaic of human beings have
their seasons of reverie&mdash;pleasing or mournful,
which are, unknown often to themselves,
the poetry of their lives. Such was
the drama Lewis Hammond was now rehearsing
in his retrospective dreams.</p>

<p>The wan and weary mother, whom he remembered
as always clothed in widow's
weeds, and toiling in painful drudgery to
maintain herself and her only boy; who
had smiled and wept, rendered thanksgivings
and uttered prayers for strength, alternately,
as she heard Mr. Marlow's proposal
to protect and help the lad through
the world that had borne so hardly upon
her; who had strained him to her bosom,
and shed fast, hot tears of speechless anguish
at their parting&mdash;a farewell that
was never to be forgotten in any meeting
on this side of eternity; this was the vision,
hers the palladium of love, that had nerved
him for the close wrestle with fortune,
guarded him amid the burning ploughshares
of temptation, carried him unscathed
past the hundred mouths of hell,
that gape upon the innocent and unwary
in all large cities. Cold and unsusceptible
as he was deemed in society, he kept unpolluted
in his breast a fresh living stream
of genuine romantic feeling, such as we are
apt to think went out of fashion&mdash;aye, and
out of being&mdash;with the belted knights of
yore; wealth he had vowed never to squander,
never reveal, until he should pour it,
without one thought of self-reserve, upon
his wife! He never hinted this to a living
creature before the moment came for revealing
it to the object of his choice. He
was a "predestined old bachelor!" and "infidel
to love and the sex," said and believed
the gay and frivolous, and he let them talk.
His ideal woman, his mother's representative
and successor&mdash;the beauty and crown
of his existence&mdash;was too sacred for the
gaze and comment of indifferent worldlings.
For her he labored and studied and lived;
confident in a fatalistic belief that, at the
right moment, the dream would become a
reality&mdash;the phantasm leave her cloudy
height for his arms.</p>

<p>Love so beautiful and intense as this, like
snow in its purity, like fire in its fervor,
cannot be won to full and eloquent utterance
but by answering love&mdash;a sentiment
identical in kind, if not equal in degree;
and Sarah Hammond's estimate of her husband's
affection was, in consequence of this
want in herself, cruelly unjust in its coldness
and poverty. His patience with her
transient fits of gloom or waywardness in
the early months of their married life; his
noble forgetfulness of her faults, and grateful
acknowledgment of her most trifling effort
to please him; his unceasing care; his
lavish bounty&mdash;all these she attributed too
much to natural amiability and conscientious
views of duty; too little to his warm
regard for her personally. In this persuasion
she had copied his conduct in externals
so far as she could; and applauding observers
adjudged the mock gem to be a
fair and equitable equivalent for the rare
pearl she had received.</p>

<p>Lest this digression, into which I have
been inadvertently betrayed, should mislead
any with the idea that I have some design
of dignifying into a hero this respectable,
but very commonplace personage, return
we to him as he hears eleven o'clock rung
out by the monitor on the mantel, and says
to himself, "Baby Belle has been asleep
these three hours, and mamma, caring
nothing for beaux and ball-room, is preparing
to follow her."</p>

<p>Beaux and ball-room! Pshaw! why should
the nonsensical talk of that jackanapes,
George Bond, come to his mind just then?
The whole tenor of the remarks that succeeded
the name that he imagined was his
disproved that imagination. But who had
left his wife at Newport in the care of a
"good-looking" brother-in-law? who had
been domesticated in the family of the deluded
husband for a fortnight?</p>

<p>Pshaw again! What concern had he
with that scandalous, doubtless slanderous
tattle?</p>

<p>"Why did you not marry her when you
had the opportunity? She was willing
enough!"</p>

<p>Could Lucy have spoken thus of her sister?
Sarah was barely acquainted with
Philip Benson when Lucy wedded him,
having met him but once prior to the wedding
day at the house of her aunt in the
country, from which place his own letter,
penned by her father's sick-bed, recalled
her. How far from his thoughts then was
the rapid train of consequences that followed
upon this preliminary act of their
intercourse!</p>

<p>Did that scoundrel Bond say "Hammond"?
It was not a common name, and
came quite distinctly to his ears in the high,
unpleasant key he so disliked. A flush of
honest shame arose to his forehead at this
uncontrollable straying of his ideas to a
topic so disagreeable, and so often rejected
by his mind.</p>

<p>"As if&mdash;even had I been the person insulted
by his pity&mdash;I would believe one syllable
he said of a woman as far above him
in virtue and intellect, in everything good
and lovable, as the heavens are above the
earth! I would despise myself as much as
I do him if I could lend my ear for an instant
to so degrading a whisper! I wish
I had faced him and demanded the whole
tale; yet no! that would have been rash
and absurd. Better as it is! By to-morrow
I shall laugh at my ridiculous fancies!"</p>

<p>"Scratch! scratch! scratch!" The house
was so still in the approaching midnight
that the slight noise caused him a shock
and quiver in the excited state of his
nerves. The interruption was something
between a scrape and a rap, three times repeated,
and proceeding, apparently, from
the bookcase at his right. What could it
be? He had never seen or heard of a
mouse on the premises, nor did the sound
much resemble the nibbling of that animal.
Ashamed of the momentary thrill he
had experienced, he remained still and collected,
awaiting its repetition.</p>

<p>"Scratch! scratch! rap!" It was in the
bookcase&mdash;in the lower part where were
drawers shut in by solid doors. These he
had never explored, but knew that his wife
kept pamphlets and papers in them. He
opened the outer doors cautiously, and listened
again, until assured by the scratching
that his search was in the right direction.
There were three drawers&mdash;two deep,
the third and upper shallow. This he drew
out and examined. It contained writing-paper
and envelopes, all in good order.
Nor was there any sign of the intruder
amongst the loose music and periodicals in
the second. The lower one was locked&mdash;no
doubt accidentally, for he had never
seen Sarah lock up anything except jewels
and money. Their servants were honest,
and she had no cause to fear investigation
on his part.</p>

<p>Feeling, rather than arguing thus, he
removed the drawer above, leaving exposed
the locked one, and thrust his hand down
into it. It encountered the polished surface
of a small box or case, which he was
in the act of drawing through the aperture
left by the second drawer, when
something dark and swift ran over his
hand and up his sleeve. With a violent
start, he dashed the casket to the floor,
and another energetic fling of his arm
dislodged the mouse. His first care was to
pursue and kill it; his next to examine
into the damage it had indirectly produced.
The box&mdash;ebony, lined with sandal-wood&mdash;had
fallen with such force as to loosen
the spring, and lay on its side wide open;
its treasures strewed over the carpet.
They were neither numerous, nor in themselves
valuable. A bouquet of dried flowers,
enveloped in silver paper, lay nearest
Lewis' hand, as he knelt to pick up the
scattered articles. The paper was tied
about the stalks of the flowers with black
ribbon, and to this was attached a card:
"Will Miss Sarah accept this trifling token
of regard from one who is her stanch
friend, and hopes, in time, to have a
nearer claim upon her esteem?"</p>

<p>The hand was familiar to the reader as
Philip Benson's. Why should Sarah preserve
this, while the many floral tokens of
his love which she had received were flung
away when withered like worthless weeds?
The pang of jealousy was new&mdash;sharp as
the death-wrench to the heart-strings,
cruel as the grave! The card was without
date, or he would have read, with a
different apprehension of its meaning, the
harmless clause&mdash;"And hopes in time to
have a nearer claim upon her esteem."
There was a time, then, when, as Lucy
had taunted her husband, he might have
married her sister! when Sarah loved him,
and had reason to think herself beloved
in return! What was this sable badge but
the insignia of a bereaved heart, that
mourned still in secret the faithlessness
of her early love, or the adverse fate that
had sundered him from her, and given him
to another?</p>

<p>Crushing the frail, dead stems in his
hand, he threw them back into the box,
and took up a bit of dark gray wood,
rough on one side&mdash;smoothed on the other
into a rude tablet. "Philip Benson, Deal
Beach, July 27th, 1856. Pensez a moi!"
But ten days before he met her at the
wharf in New York to take her to her
sick father! but three months before she
plighted her troth to him, promised to
wed him, while in spirit she was still
weeping tears of blood over the inconstant!
for he did not forget that Philip's engagement
to Lucy preceded his own to
Sarah by eight or nine weeks. There were
other relics in the box; a half-worn glove,
retaining the shape of the manly hand it
had inclosed&mdash;which, he learned afterwards,
Philip had left in his chamber at the
farm-house when he departed to seek gayer
scenes; a white shell, upon whose rosy
lining were scratched with the point of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
knife the ominous initials, "P. B." and
beneath them "S. B. H.," a faded rosebud,
and several printed slips, cut from
the columns of newspapers. He unfolded
but two of these.</p>

<p>One was an extract from Tennyson's
"Maud"&mdash;the invitation to the garden.
Breathlessly, by reason of the terrible
stricture tightening around his heart, Lewis
ran his eyes over the charming whimsical
morceau. They rested upon and reviewed
the last verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She is coming&mdash;my own, my sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were it ever so airy a tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart would hear her and beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were it earth in an earthy bed,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My dust would hear her and beat;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had I laid for a century dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would start and tremble under her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And blossom in purple and red."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He did not discriminate now between
printed and written verses. These were
love stanzas sent by another man to his
wife, received and cherished by her, hidden
away with a care that, in itself, bordered
on criminality, for was not its object the
deception of the injured husband? The
most passionate autograph love-letter
could hardly have stabbed him more
keenly.</p>

<p>The other was Mrs. Browning's exquisite
"Portrait."</p>

<p>And here the reader can have an explanation
the tortured man could not obtain.
With the acumen for which Cupid's
votaries are proverbial, Philip Benson, then
at the "summer heat" degree of his flame
for the Saratoga belle, had recognized in
this poem the most correct and beautiful
description of his lady-love. Curiosity to
see if the resemblance were apparent to
other eyes, and a desire for sympathy
tempted him to forward it to Sarah. She
must perceive the likeness to her divine
sister, and surmise the sentiment that had
induced him to send it. A little alteration
in the opening stanza was requisite to
make it a "perfect fit." Thus it was when
the change was made:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will paint her as I see her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">---- times have the lilies blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since she looked upon the sun."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poetess, guiltless of any intention to
cater for the wants of grown-up lovers,
had written "Ten" in the space made
blank by Philip's gallantry and real ignorance
of his charmer's age. For the rest,
the "lily-clear face," the "forehead fair
and saintly," the "trail of golden hair,"
the blue eyes, "like meek prayers before
a shrine," the voice that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Murmurs lowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a silver stream may run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet feels you feel the sun,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>were, we may safely assert, quite as much
like poor Sarah, when he sent the poem,
as they were now like the portrait he
would&mdash;if put upon his oath&mdash;sketch of his
unidealized Lucy.</p>

<p>It was not unnatural then, in Lewis
Hammond, to overlook in his present state,
these glaring discrepancies in the picture
as applied by him. With a blanched and
rigid countenance he put all the things
back in the box, shut it, and restored it
to its place. Then he knelt on the floor
and hid his face in his wife's chair; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
there struggled out into the still air of the
desecrated hometemple, made sacred by
his love and her abiding, deep sobs from
the strong man's stricken heart&mdash;a grief
as much more fearful than that of widowhood,
as the desertion and dishonor of the
loved one are worse than death.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>It was the "grand hop" night at the
headquarters of Newport fashion. Sarah,
characteristically indifferent to gaieties
"made to order," had determined not to
appear below. The air of her room was
fresh and pure, and a book, yet unread,
lay under the lamp upon her table. Her
sister and mother had withdrawn to dress,
when Jeannie's curly head peeped in at
Mrs. Hammond's door. Her features wore
a most woe-begone expression.</p>

<p>"What has gone wrong, Jeannie?" inquired
Sarah.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma says that I will be in her
way if I go into the ball-room; and it
will be so stupid to stay out the whole
evening, while all the other girls can see
the dancing and dresses, and hear the
music. And sister Lucy says that children
are 'bores' in company."</p>

<p>"A sad state of affairs, certainly! Perhaps
I may persuade mother to let you
go."</p>

<p>"Yes; but if she does, she will sit close
against the wall with a lot of other fat
old ladies, and they will talk over my
head, and squeeze me almost to death,
besides rumpling my dress; and I so want
to wear my tucked pink grenadine, sister!"</p>

<p>"And you would like to have me to
go down with you; is that it?"</p>

<p>Jeannie's eyes beamed delightedly. "Oh,
if you only would!"</p>

<p>Sarah looked down into the eager face
and saw, in anticipation, her own little
Belle imploring some boon, as important
to her, as easy to be granted by another
as this, and consented with a kiss.</p>

<p>"Run away and bring your finery here!
Mother is too busy to attend to you. Mary
can dress you."</p>

<p>The order was obeyed with lightning
speed; and Sarah, still holding in the excited
child the foreshadowing of her darling's
girlhood, superintended the toilet,
while she made herself ready.</p>

<p>"What shall I wear, Jeannie?" she asked
carelessly, holding open the door of her
wardrobe.</p>

<p>"Oh, that lovely fawn-colored silk, please!
the one with the black lace flounces! It
is the prettiest color I ever saw; and I
heard Mrs. Greyling tell another lady the
night you wore it, when brother Lewis
was here, you know, that it was one of
the richest dresses in the room, modest
as it looked, and that the flounce must
have cost a penny!"</p>

<p>"Probably more!"</p>

<p>Sarah proceeded to array herself in the
fortunate robe that had won the praises
of the fashionably distinguished Mrs.
Greyling. Her abundant dark hair was
lighted by two coral sprigs, which formed
the heads of her hair-pins, and, handkerchief
and gloves in hand, she was taking
a last survey of Jeannie's more brilliant
costume, when there came a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson!" said Mary, unclosing it.</p>

<p>"May I come in?" he asked.</p>

<p>The tidy Mary had removed all trace of the
recent tiring operations from the apartment,
which was a compound of parlor
and dressing-room, a necessary adjunct
to the small chamber and smaller nursery,
leading out of it, at the side and rear.</p>

<p>"You may!" replied Sarah. "Here is an
aspirant for ball-room honors, who awaits
your approval."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, que vous etes charmante!
I am penetrated with profound admiration!"
exclaimed the teasing brother-in-law,
raising his hands in true melodramatic
style.</p>

<p>Jeannie laughed and blushed until her
cheeks matched the grenadine.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hunt told me that you had
changed your mind, and intended to grace
the festive scene with your presence,"
continued Philip, addressing Sarah. "She
and Lucy are there, and the dancing has
begun. I came to escort you and our fair
debutante here&mdash;that is, unless some one
else has offered his services and been accepted."</p>

<p>"That is not likely, since Mr. Hammond
left us in your care. Do not your fourfold
duties oppress you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. If all my charges were
as chary of their calls upon me as you
are, my time would hang heavily upon
my hands. No one would imagine, from
your reluctance to be waited upon, that
you had been spoiled at home. If Mr.
Hammond were here now, he would tell
you to draw that shawl"&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is an opera cloak!" interrupted Jeannie.</p>

<p>"A ball-cloak to-night, then, is it not?
I was saying that, although the night is
not cool for sea air, you had better wrap
that mantle about your chest and throat
as we go out."</p>

<p>Just outside the door a waiter passed
them with a note in his hand. He stopped,
on seeing Philip.</p>

<p>"Mr. Benson! I was on my way to
your rooms with this, sir."</p>

<p>Philip stepped back within the parlor
to read it by the light. It was a line from
a friend who had just arrived at another
hotel notifying him of this fact. It required
no reply, and, leaving it upon the
table, he rejoined his companions.</p>

<p>"See mamma! Isn't it just as I said?"
whispered Jeannie, as she established herself
beside her sister in a comfortable corner
that commanded a view of the spacious
hall and its gay, restless sea of
figures.</p>

<p>Sarah smiled at discovering her mother
sandwiched between two portly dowagers;
one in purple, the other in lavender silk;
all three bobbing and waving in their
earnest confabulations, in a style that
presented a ludicrously marked resemblance
to the gesticulations of a group of
Muscovy ducks, on the margin of a mud-puddle,
held by them in their capacity of
a joint-stock company.</p>

<p>"I see that Lucy has taken the floor,"
observed Philip. "She will not thank me
for any devoirs I could render her for
the next three hours. If they get up anything
so humble as quadrilles, may I ask
the pleasure of your company for the set?"</p>

<p>"If you wish it&mdash;and my dress is not
too grave in hue"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And too decorous in its make, you were
about to add, I presume;" he finished the
sentence bluntly. "It forms a refreshing
contrast to the prevailing style around
us."</p>

<p>Lucy here flitted into sight, and her very
bare arms and shoulders pointed her husband's
strictures. A stool, brought into
the room for the use of some child or
invalid looker-on of the festivities, now
stood empty under Sarah's chair, and
Philip, espying it, seized upon and drew it
forth. When seated, his mouth was nearly
on a level with Sarah's ear.</p>

<p>"This is pleasant!" he said. "We are
quite as much isolated from the rest of
mankind as if we were sitting among the
heathery hillocks on Deal Beach. You do
not love the visions of those tranquil sunny
days as I do. You never allude to them
voluntarily. Yet you have had less to
convert your dreams into every-day actualities,
tedious and prosaic, than I have.
I stand in direful need of one of the old
lectures, inculcating more charity, and less
study of complex motives and biassed tendencies
in the machine we call Man. Begin!
I am at your mercy."</p>

<p>"I have forgotten how to deliver them.
I am out of practice."</p>

<p>"That is not surprising. Your husband
is behind the age he lives in&mdash;and so are
you. You two would make Barnum's fortune,
could he ever persuade the public of
your idiosyncrasies."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Look around and through this room,
and you will understand one part of my
meaning. Do you remark the preponderance
of married over single belles? and
that the most tenderly deferential cavaliers
are husbands, and not dancing with their
wives? I could point out to you three
men, leaders of the ton in this extremely
reputable, eminently moral assembly, who,
it is whispered among the knowing ones,
are married, and, having left their domestic
associations for a season of recreation,
boldly attach themselves to certain
stylish young ladies here, and challenge
observation, defy public censure, by their
marked and increasing devotion. I meet
them strolling along the beach in the
morning; riding together in the afternoon;
and when not engaged in this evening
exhibition of toilet and muscle, you will
find them pacing the moon or star-lit
piazza, or, perchance, again sentimentalizing
on the shore until the witching hour
draws near."</p>

<p>"You surprise me!"</p>

<p>"You have no right to be surprised. You
have the same thing continually before
you in your city. Every fashionable hotel
or boarding-house can supply you with
such flirtations by the dozen. A married
woman who declines the polite services of
all gentlemen, except her husband and
near relatives, is a prude, with false
scruples of propriety and delicacy. Let
her legal partner complain&mdash;he is cried out
upon as a despot, and you can trust the
sweet angel of an abused wife to elude
his vigilance&mdash;violence, she terms it&mdash;for
the future, without altering her conduct in
aught else. Do you see that pretty woman
in blue&mdash;the one with the madonna-like
face? Her tyrant is here but once a week&mdash;from
Saturday until Monday&mdash;then hies
back to the business he loves as well as
she does her pleasure. Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the
forenoon of Saturday, any mustachioed
puppy may walk, talk, drive, and flirt with
her&mdash;bask in the rays of those liquid orbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
When the rightful lord appears, she is
demure as a nun, patient as a saint, dutiful
as Griselda, to him and him alone.
Do you begin to understand why I congratulated
you upon having a husband
of the olden stamp? Why, I do from my
heart felicitate my friend Hammond upon
having gained, as a helpmeet, one of that
nearly obsolete species&mdash;Woman!"</p>

<p>Sarah's embarrassment was painful and
but indifferently concealed. She felt that
it was barely excusable, in consideration
of his fraternal relation to her, for Philip
to speak so plainly of this social blemish;
and altogether unpardonable, while he did
not, or could not, prevent his wife's participation
in the questionable gaieties he
assailed so unsparingly. Reply she could
not, without implicating Lucy in her reprobation,
and he must perceive her difficulty.
This was the trouble that lay uppermost.
At her heart's core, the uneasy
feeling she ever experienced in conversation
with him; the stirring of the entombed
love, of whose actual death she
had horrible misgivings; the incongruous
blending of past emotion with present
duty, were now aggravated by the enforced
acceptance of unmerited praise. Her
woman's instinct, her experience as a wife,
told her that the cause of the sinful
recklessness, the contempt of the true
spirit of the marriage tie, was not the
fruit merely of the vanity and thirst for
adulation, to which it was properly attributed.
With the recollection of her
own life, the education she had received at
home, the hateful, yet even to her independent
spirit, resistless decrees of society,
there swelled up within her bosom something
akin to Philip's bitter cynicism. Under
this spur, she spoke.</p>

<p>"And from these signs of the times, you
would argue an inherent degeneracy of
womanhood&mdash;a radical change in its composition,
such as some anatomists tell us
has taken place in the structure of our
bodies&mdash;our blood&mdash;our very teeth. A dentist,
who filled a tooth for me the other
day, imparted divers scientific items of
information to me that may illustrate your
position. 'Enamel, madam, is not what
enamel was in the days of our ancestors!'
he affirmed pathetically; 'the color, the
very ingredients of the bone, the calcareous
base of the teeth, differ sadly from
the indestructible molars of fifty years
ago.' At this passage of his jeremiade, he
chanced to touch the nerve in the unhappy
'molar' he was excavating, and I am persuaded
that I suffered as really as my
grandmother would have done, had she
sat in my place."</p>

<p>She paused, and beat time with her fingers
on Jeannie's shoulder to the wild,
varying waltz that swept the giddy crowd
around the room in fast and flying circles.</p>

<p>"Your analogy asserts, then, that at
heart women are alike in all ages?"</p>

<p>"Why not, as well as men?"</p>

<p>"Then why does not action remain the
same, if that be true?"</p>

<p>"Because custom&mdash;fashion, if you prefer
this name&mdash;an unaccountable, irresponsible
power&mdash;owing its birth oftenest to accident
or caprice, says, 'Do this!' and it is done!
be it to perpetrate a cravat-bow, a marriage,
or a murder!"</p>

<p>Another pause&mdash;in which music and
dancers seemed sweeping on to sweet intoxication&mdash;so
joyous in their abandon were
the gushing strains; so swift the whirl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the living ring. The fingers played lightly
and rapidly on Jeannie's plump shoulder&mdash;then
rested on a half-beat.</p>

<p>"Yes!" She was looking towards the
crowd, but her eye was fixed, and her
accents slow and grave. "Hearts live and
hearts love, while time endures. The heart
selects its mate in life's springtime, with
judgment as untaught as that of the silly
bird that asks no companion but the one
the God of Nature has bestowed upon it.
But you see not, my good brother"&mdash;she
faced him, a smile wreathing her lip&mdash;a
strange glitter in her eye&mdash;"see you not
to what woeful disorders these untrained
desires, this unsophisticated following out
of unregulated affections would give rise?
It would sap the foundations of caste;
level all wholesome distinctions of society;
consign the accomplished daughters of
palatial halls&mdash;hoary with a semi-decade
of years&mdash;to one-story cottages and a maid-of-all
work; doom nice young men to
the drudgery of business for the remainder
of their wretched lives, to maintain
wives whose dowries would not keep their
lily-handed lords in French kids for a
year; cover managing mammas with ignominy,
and hasten ambitious papas to
their costly vaults in&mdash;as Dickens has it&mdash;'some
genteel place of interment.' Come
what may of blasted hopes and wrecked
hearts, the decencies of life must be observed.
Every heart has its nerve&mdash;genuine,
sensitive, sometimes vulgarly tenacious
of life&mdash;but there are corrosives that
will eat it out; fine, deadly wires, that
can probe and torture and extract it. And
when the troublesome thing is finally gotten
rid of, there is an end to all obstacles
to judicious courtships and eligible alliances!"
She laughed scornfully, and Philip
recoiled, without knowing why he did so,
as he heard her.</p>

<p>"That is all very well, when the nature
of the contract is understood on both
sides," he said, gloomily. "I doubt, however,
whether the beautiful economy of
your system will be appreciated by those
whose living hearts are bound to the
bloodless plaster-casts you describe."</p>

<p>"These accidents will occur in spite of
caution on the part of the best managers
of suitable marriages. By far the larger
proportion of the shocks inflicted upon
polite circles arise from this very cause.
Pygmalion grows weary of wooing his
statue, and wants sympathy in his disappointment
and loneliness."</p>

<p>The dance was ended. The fantastic
variations of the waltz were exchanged
for a noble march&mdash;pealing through the
heated rooms like a rush of the healthful
sea-breeze. The spark died in Sarah's
eye. Her voice took its habitual pitch.</p>

<p>"I have permitted myself to become excited,
and, I am afraid, have said many
things that I had no right to think&mdash;much
less to utter. If my freedom has displeased
you, I am sorry."</p>

<p>"The error&mdash;if error there were&mdash;was
mine," rejoined Philip. "I led the conversation
into the channel; you, after awhile,
followed. I believe there is no danger of
our misunderstanding each other."</p>

<p>"Darby and Joan! good children in the
corner!" cried Lucy, flushed with exercise
and radiant with good humor, as she
promenaded past them leaning on the
arm of a young West Pointer, a native
Southerner and an acquaintance of
Philip's. If his wife must flirt and frolic,
he was watchful that she did not compromise
him by association with doubtful
characters. On several occasions, the advances
of gay gentlemen, whose toilets
were more nearly irreproachable than their
reputations, had been checked by his cool
and significant resumption of the husband's
post beside the belle, and, if need
existed, by the prompt withdrawal of the
unwilling lady from the scene. The cadet
laughed, and, convinced that she had said
a witty thing, Lucy swam by.</p>

<p>"The common sense of our tropes, rodomontades,
and allegories is this!" said
Philip, biting his lip, and speaking in a
hard tone. "The only safe ground in marriage
is mutual, permanent affection. You
meant to convey the idea that if each of
these dressy matrons, humming around
our ears, had a sincere, abiding love for
her husband&mdash;and each of these gallant
benedicts the right kind of regard for his
wedded Beatrice, the vocation of us corner
censors would be gone?"</p>

<p>"Well said, Mr. Interpreter!" she responded,
in affected jest.</p>

<p>"This point settled, will you take my
arm for a turn through the room before
the next set is formed? They are talking
of quadrilles. I shall claim your promise
if a set is made up, unless you are not
courageous enough to brave the public
sneer by dancing with your brother. Come,
Jeannie, and walk with us."</p>

<p>Two sets of quadrilles were arranged at
different ends of the saloon. Philip led
Sarah through one, with Lucy&mdash;who considered
it a capital joke&mdash;and her partner
vis-a-vis to them, Jeannie, meanwhile, remaining
by her mother.</p>

<p>The summer nights were short; and,
when the dance was over, Sarah intimated
to her younger sister the propriety of retiring.
Mrs. Hunt's head ached, and she
esteemed the sacrifice comparatively light,
therefore, that she, too, had to leave the
revels and accompany the child to her
chamber. Sarah's apartments were on the
same floor, several doors further on. Having
said "Good-night" to the others, she
and Philip walked slowly along the piazza,
light as day in the moonbeams, until they
reached the outer room, the parlor.</p>

<p>"I hope you will experience no ill effects
from your dissipation," said Philip, in
playful irony. "In a lady of your staid
habits, this disposition to gaiety is alarming.
Absolutely eleven o'clock! What will
Hammond say when he hears the story?
Good-night! Don't let your conscience
keep you awake!"</p>

<p>Sarah opened the door softly, that she
might not startle the baby-sleeper in the
inner room. The lamp was shining brightly,
and by it sat&mdash;her husband!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>Lewis had entered his wife's room within
fifteen minutes after she left it. He
looked so ill and weary that the girl,
Mary, gave a stifled scream of fright and
surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, sir?" she asked hastily,
as he threw off his hat, and wiped his pale
forehead. "Shall I tell Mrs. Hammond that
you are here? She went down to the ball-room
awhile ago."</p>

<p>"What did you say? No!" replied he,
shortly.</p>

<p>His frown, rather than his tone, silenced
her. He had picked up the envelope
Philip had dropped on the table, and his
face darkened still more. Too proud to
question a servant of her mistress' actions
and associates, he believed that he had
gathered from this mute witness all that
was needful to know. As a privileged
habitue of the cosy boudoir he had been
at such pain to procure and make fit for
his wife's occupancy, another had sat here
and read his evening mail, while awaiting
her leisure; careless of appearances, since
the deceived one would not be there to
notice them, had tossed this note down
with as much freedom as he would have
done in his own apartment.</p>

<p>Through the open windows poured the
distant strains of the band; and, seized by
a sudden thought, he caught up his hat
and strode out, along piazzas and through
halls, to the entrance door of the ball
saloon. As Sarah's ill-fortune ordained it,
the piercing glance that ran over and beyond
the crowd of spectators and dancers
detected her at the instant of Philip's
taking his lowly seat at her side. Jeannie's
pink attire was concealed by the drapery
of a lady, whose place in the set then
forming was directly in front of her.
Lewis saw but the two, virtually tete-a-tete;
and, as he obtained fleeting glimpses
of them through the shifting throng,
marked Philip's energetic, yet confidential
discourse, and the intentness with which
she listened, until, warmed or excited by
his theme, Sarah lifted her downcast eyes
and spoke, with what feeling and effect her
auditor's varying expression showed.</p>

<p>The gazer stood there like a statue, unheeding
the surprised and questioning
looks cast by passers-by upon his traveling-dress,
streaked with dust&mdash;his sad and
settled visage, so unbefitting the scene
within&mdash;while Philip made the tour of the
room, with Sarah upon his arm, until
they took their stations for the dance; he,
courteous and attentive&mdash;she, smiling and
happy, more beautiful in her husband's
eyes than her blonde sister opposite; and
he could stay no longer. If Mary had
thought him sick and cross at his former
entrance, she considered him savage now,
for one who was ordinarily a kind and
gentle master.</p>

<p>"You can go to your room!" he ordered,
not advised. "I will sit up for Mrs. Hammond!"</p>

<p>"I have slept in the nursery, sir, while
you were away."</p>

<p>"That cannot be to-night. I will find
you some other place."</p>

<p>He had no intention that the anticipated
conversation with his wife should be overheard.</p>

<p>"I can stay with a friend of mine, sir,
only a few doors off."</p>

<p>"Very well!"</p>

<p>Quickly and quietly the nurse arranged
the night-lamp and the child's food, that
her mistress might have no trouble during
her absence, and went out.</p>

<p>Baby Belle slumbered on, happily wandering
through the guileless mazes of baby
dreamland; one little arm, bared from
the sleeve of her gown, thrown above her
head&mdash;the hand of the other cradling her
cheek. The father ventured to press a
light kiss upon the red lips. In his desolation,
he craved this trifling solace. The
child's face was contorted by an expression
of discomfort, and, still dreaming,
she murmured, in her inarticulate language,
some pettish expression of disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"My very child shrinks from me! It is
in the blood!" said the unhappy man,
drawing back from the crib.</p>

<p>If his resolution had waned at sight of
the sleeper, it was fixed again when he
returned to his chair in the outer room.
He raised his head from his folded arms
when he heard Philip and Sarah approaching,
but did not otherwise alter his position.
The low tone of their parting words&mdash;one
soon learned by the sojourners in
hotels and watering-places, where thin
partitions and ventilators abound&mdash;was, to
him, the cautiously repressed voice of affectionate
good-nights. But one clause was
distinct&mdash;"What will Hammond say, when
he hears the story?" They jested thus of
him, then. One of them, at least, should
learn ere long what he would say.</p>

<p>"Lewis, you here!"</p>

<p>Sarah changed color with amazement and
vague alarm&mdash;emotion that paralyzed her
momentarily. Then, as she discerned the
tokens of disorder in his dress and countenance,
she hurried forward.</p>

<p>"What has brought you so unexpectedly?
Are you sick? Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>He did not rise; and, resting her hand
on his shoulder, she stooped for a kiss.
But his stern gaze never moved from hers&mdash;anxious
and inquiring&mdash;and his lips were
like stone.</p>

<p>"Lewis, speak to me! If you have dreadful
news to tell me, for pity's sake, do
not keep me in suspense!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say that will be new
to you," he said, without relaxing his
hard, cold manner, "and not a great deal
that ought to have been kept back from
me when I wished to marry you, believing
that you had a heart to give me with your
hand."</p>

<p>As if struck in the face, Sarah sank
back into a chair, speechless and trembling.</p>

<p>"Yes! had you been sincere with me
then, grieved and disappointed as I would
have felt, I would have respected you the
more, and loved you none the less for
the disclosure. But when, after a year
and a half of married life, I learn that
the woman I have loved and trusted with
my whole soul&mdash;from whom I have never
concealed a thought that it could interest
her to know&mdash;has all the while been playing
a false part&mdash;vowing at the altar to love
me and me alone, when she secretly idolized
another; bearing my name, living beneath
my roof, sleeping in my bosom&mdash;yet
thinking of, and caring for him, treasuring
his keepsakes as the most precious of her
possessions&mdash;is it strange that, when the
tongue of a vulgar gossip proclaims my
shame in my hearing, and other evidence
proves what I thought was his vile slander
to be true as gospel&mdash;is it strange, I say,
that I am incensed at the deception practised
upon me&mdash;at the infamous outrage of
my dearest hopes&mdash;my most holy feelings?"</p>

<p>She threw herself at his feet, clasped his
knees, and implored him, chokingly, to
"forgive" her. "Oh! if you knew what I
have suffered!"</p>

<p>"What you have suffered!" He folded
his arms and looked sorrowfully down at
her crouching figure. "Yes! you were not
by nature coarse and unfeeling! The violence
you have committed upon your
heart and every principle of delicacy and
truth must have cost you pain. Then you
loved him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once! a long while ago!" said Sarah,
hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Take care!" There was no softness
now in his tone. "Remember that I have
seen you together day by day, and that
glances and actions, unnoticed at the time
in my stupid blindness, recur to me now
with terrible meaning. For once, speak
the true voice of feeling, and own what
I know already, that all the love you
ever had to give belongs still to your
sister's husband!"</p>

<p>"I will speak the truth!" Sarah arose
and stood before him&mdash;face livid and eyes
burning. "I did love this man! I married
you, partly to please my parents,
partly because I found out that by some
means my secret had fallen into unscrupulous
hands, and I was mad with dread
of its exposure! It seemed to me that no
worse shame could come upon me than
to have it trumpeted abroad that I had
bestowed my love unsought, and was ready
to die because it was slighted. I have
learned since that it is far, far worse to
live a lie&mdash;to despise myself! Oh! that I
had died then!" She battled with the
emotion that threatened to overwhelm her
and went on. "Once bound to you, it has
been my hourly endeavor to feel and act
as became the faithful wife of a kind,
noble man. If, sometimes, I have erred
in thought&mdash;if my feelings have failed me
in the moment of trial&mdash;yet, in word and
deed, in look and gesture, I have been
true to you. No one have I deceived more
thoroughly than Philip Benson. He never
suspected my unfortunate partiality for
himself; he believes me still, what I would
give worlds to become in truth, your loyal,
loving wife! It is well that you know
the truth at last. I do not ask you how
you have obtained the outlines of a disgraceful
story, that I have tried a thousand
times to tell you, but was prevented
by the fear of losing your favour forever.
This is my poor defence&mdash;not against your
charges, but in palliation of the sin of
which they justly accuse me. I can say
nothing more. Do with me as you will!"</p>

<p>"It is but just to myself that you should
hear the circumstances which accidentally
revealed this matter to me."</p>

<p>He narrated the scene at the restaurant,
and the discovery of the evening. He
evinced neither relenting nor sympathy in
the recital. Her confession had extinguished
the last ray of hope, cherished,
though unacknowledged by himself, that
she might extenuate her error or give a
more favorable construction to the evidence
against her. It was not singular
that, in the reaction of disappointment, he
was ready to believe that he had not
heard all; to imagine that he could perceive
throughout her statement a disposition
to screen Philip, that was, in itself,
a proof of disingenuousness, if not deliberate
falsehood. She denied that he had ever
been aware of her attachment or had
reciprocated it. What meant then those
words&mdash;"hopes in time to have a nearer
claim?" What those impassioned verses?
What the linking of their initials within
the shell? the motto on the wooden tablet?
While these subtle queries were insinuated
into his soul by some mocking spirit, he
concluded the history of the discovery of
the casket.</p>

<p>"I have never opened it since the night
before I was married," said Sarah, with no
haste of self-justification. "I put it into
the drawer the day after we went to our
house. It has not been unlocked from
that day to this."</p>

<p>"Why keep it at all, unless as a memento
of one still dear to you?"</p>

<p>"I felt as if I had buried it. I said to
myself: 'If the time ever comes when I
can disinter these relics and show them to
my husband, without a pang or fear, as
mementoes of a dead and almost forgotten
folly, he shall destroy them, and I shall
have gained a victory that will insure my
lifelong happiness.'"</p>

<p>"And that time has never arrived."</p>

<p>She would have spoken, but her tongue
proved traitorous. She crimsoned and was
silent.</p>

<p>Lewis smiled drearily. "You see that
I know you better than you do yourself.
It is well, as you have said, that I know
all at last. I pity you! If I could, I would
release you from your bondage. As it is,
I will do all that I can for this end."</p>

<p>"Never!" cried Sarah, shuddering. "Have
you forgotten our child?"</p>

<p>"I have not!" His voice shook for a
second. "She is all that unites us now.
For the sake of her future&mdash;her good name&mdash;an
open separation ought to be avoided,
if possible&mdash;if it be inevitable, your conduct
must not be the ostensible cause. To
quiet malicious tongues, you must remain
here awhile longer under your mother's
care. To accomplish the same end, I must
appear once more in public, and on apparently
friendly terms with&mdash;your brother-in-law.
When your mother returns to the
city, you had best go, too, and to your
own house. Your brother Robert is now
sixteen years old&mdash;steady and manly
enough to act as your protector. Invite
him to stay with you, and also Jeannie, if
you find it lonely."</p>

<p>"What are you saying? Where will you
be that you speak of my choosing another
protector?"</p>

<p>"A very important one I have proved
myself to be!" he returned, with the same
sad smile. "I have not been able to shield
you from invidious reports; still less to
save you from yourself. I sail for Europe
day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Lewis, you will not! If you ever loved
me, do not desert me and our child now!
I will submit to any punishment but this!"
She clung anew to his knees as she poured
out her prayer.</p>

<p>Not a month ago she had turned pale
with fright at the suggestion of this
voyage. It was sheer acting then! why
not now?</p>

<p>"Objections are useless!" he said. "My
arrangements are made. I have passed
my word."</p>

<p>"But you will not leave me in anger!
Say that you will forgive me! that you
will return soon, and this miserable night
be forgotten!"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you when I will return?"
He raised her head, and looked straight
into her eyes. "When you write to me,
and tell me that you have destroyed the
love-tokens in that box; when you bid
me come back for your sake&mdash;not for our
child's! Until then, I shall believe that
my presence would be irksome to you. It
is necessary for our house to have a resident
partner in England. It is my expectation
to fill that place for some time
to come; it shall be for you to say how
long."</p>

<p>Bowed as Sarah's spirit was beneath
the burst of the long-dreaded storm and
her accusing conscience, her womanly
pride revolted at this speech. She had
humbled herself in the dust at the feet of
a man whom she did not love; had borne
meekly his reproaches; submitted dumbly
to the degrading suspicions that far transcended
her actual sin; but as the idea of
her suing servilely for the love she had
never yet valued; of him, indifferent and
independent, awaiting afar off for her petition&mdash;hers,
whom he had abandoned to the
scornful sneers of the keen-witted hyenas
of society; to the cross-examination of
her distrustful relatives; the stings of
remorse; left in one word to herself!&mdash;as
this picture grew up clearly before her
mind, the tide of feeling turned.</p>

<p>"You reject my prayers and despise my
tears!" she said proudly. "You refuse to
accept of my humiliation. Yet you do not
doubt me, as you would have me believe
that you do! Else you would not dare to
trust me&mdash;the keeper of your honor and
your child's fair name&mdash;out of your sight!
I throw back the charge in your teeth,
and tell you that your conduct gives it the
lie! I have asked you&mdash;shame on me that
I did!&mdash;to continue to me the shelter of
your name and presence; to shield me, a
helpless woman, more unhappy than guilty,
from the ban of the world; and you deny
me everything but a contemptible shadow
of respectability, which the veriest fool
can penetrate. I would not have you suppose
that your generous confidence in my
integrity"&mdash;she brought out the words with
scathing contempt&mdash;"will deter me from
sinking to the level you are pleased to
assign me. If the native dignity of my
womanhood, the principles I inherit from
my father, my love for my innocent babe
do not hold me back from ruin, be assured
that the hope of winning your approval
will not. To you I make no pledges of
reformation; I offer but one promise. If
you choose to remain abroad until I, in
spirit, kiss your feet, and pray you to receive
a love such as most men are glad
to win by assiduity of attention, and every
pleasing art&mdash;which you would force into
being by wilful and revengeful absence&mdash;you
will never see your native land again
until the grass grows upon my grave!"</p>

<p>She paused for breath, and continued
more slowly. "While your child lives, and
I remain her guardian, I will use your
means for her maintenance&mdash;will reside in
your house. If she dies, or you take her
from me, I will not owe you my support
for a single day more!"</p>

<p>Lewis grew pallid to his lips; but he,
too, was proud, and his stubborn will was
called into bold exercise.</p>

<p>"Very well! It is in your choice to accede
to my propositions, or not. A share
in all that I have is yours; not only during
the child's life, but as long as you live.
Before I leave America, I shall deposit
for you in your father's bank a sum which,
I hope, you will find sufficient to maintain
you in comfort. Your father will be
my executor in this matter. I shall not
confide to him the peculiar circumstances
of my departure, leaving you at liberty
to act in this respect, as in everything
else, according to the dictates of your
will and pleasure. At the end of a certain
term of years specified by law, you can,
if you wish, procure a divorce; on the
ground of my wilful and continued desertion
of you; in which case, the provision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for your support will remain unchanged.
As to the child&mdash;the mother's is
the strongest claim. I shall never take
her from you. Do not let me keep you
up longer. It is late!"</p>

<p>With a silent inclination of the head, she
withdrew, and he cast himself upon the
sofa, there to lie during the few hours of
the night that were yet unspent.</p>

<p>He had arisen, and was standing at the
window when Sarah entered in the morning.
But for the dark shadows under the
eyes, and the tight-drawn look about the
mouth, she appeared as usual; and her
"Good-morning," if cold, was yet polite.</p>

<p>"I imagine," she said, as the gong clashed
out its second call, "that you wish me
to accompany you to breakfast, and to
preserve my ordinary manner towards
you when others are by. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"You are. This is all I ask. The effort
will not be a tedious one. I leave here
at noon."</p>

<p>Arm in arm they directed their steps
towards the great dining-hall&mdash;to the view
of the spectator as comfortable and happy
a pair as any that pursued that route on
that summer morning. Together they sat
down at table, and Mr. Hammond ordered
"his lady's" breakfast with his own. Mrs.
Hunt bustled in shortly after they were
seated, full of wonderment at having heard
from Sarah's maid of her master's unexpected
arrival; while Jeannie gave his
hand a squeeze as hearty as was the welcome
in her smiling face. The Bensons
were always late. So much the better.
There were more people present to observe
the cordial meeting between the brothers-in-law,
made the more conspicuous by
Philip's surprise. The genuineness of his
good spirits, his easy, unembarrassed manner,
was the best veil that could have
been devised for Sarah's constraint and
Lewis' counterfeit composure.</p>

<p>It did not escape Philip's eye that Sarah
ate nothing, and spoke only to avoid the
appearance of singularity; and he believed
that he had discovered the origin of her
trouble when Lewis communicated his purpose
of foreign travel. When the burst of
surprise subsided, the latter tried successfully
to represent his plan as a business
necessity. Lucy, who never saw an inch
beyond her nose&mdash;morally and mentally
speaking&mdash;except when her intuitions were
quickened by self-love, was the questioner
most to be dreaded.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go with him?" she inquired
of her sister. "He should not stir
one step without me, if I were in your
place. Only think! you might spend six
months in Paris!"</p>

<p>"How would Baby Belle relish a sea
voyage!" returned Sarah.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! How supremely silly! One
would suppose that she was the only member
of the family whose comfort was to
be consulted. Rather than expose her to
the possibility of inconvenience, you will
deprive yourself of profit and pleasure, and
be separated from your husband for nobody
knows how long. This shows how
much these model married people really
care for one another. When put to the
test they are no better than we poor
sinners, whom everybody calls flirts. Phil,
are those muffins warm? This one of mine
has grown cold while I was talking."</p>

<p>"How are the horses, Benson?" inquired
Lewis. "Have they been exercised regularly?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, and are in capital order. You
could have left us no more acceptable reminder
of yourself than those same fine
bays."</p>

<p>"If you have no other engagement, suppose
we have them up before the light
carriage after breakfast, and take a short
drive."</p>

<p>"Agreed, with all my heart! unless Mrs.
Hammond quarrels with me for robbing
her of a portion of your last morning with
her."</p>

<p>"She will forgive you!" Lewis rejoined,
to spare her the effort of reply.</p>

<p>From her window Sarah saw them whirl
off along the beach in sight of the hundreds
of spectators on the sands and
about the hotels, and recognized the ingenuity
of this scheme for proclaiming
the amicable feeling between the two.</p>

<p>"But one more scene, and the hateful
mockery is over!" thought the wife, as she
heard her husband's step outside the door
on his return.</p>

<p>She snatched a paper from the table, and
seemed absorbed in its contents, not looking
up at his entrance. Lewis made several
turns through the room, sighed heavily,
and once paused, as if about to address
her, but changed his mind.</p>

<p>Then sounded from without the fresh,
gurgling laugh of a child, and the nurse
came in with the baby&mdash;rosy and bright&mdash;from
her morning walk on the shore. She
almost sprang from Mary's hold at sight
of her father, and dismissing the woman
with a word, he took his darling into his
arms and sat down behind his wife. Inflexibly
sullen, Sarah tried not to listen,
as she would not see them; but she heard
every sound: the child's soft coo of satisfaction
as she nestled in the father's
bosom; the many kisses he imprinted upon
her pure face and mouth with what agony
Sarah well knew&mdash;the irregular respiration,
sometimes repressed, until its breaking
forth was like sobs; and the proud, miserable
heart confessed reluctantly that,
in one respect, his share of their divided
lot was heavier than hers. She was not
to witness his final resignation of his idol.
Under color of summoning Mary, he carried
the infant from the room, and came
back without her.</p>

<p>"It is time for me to go now, Sarah!"</p>

<p>His voice was calm, and its firmness
destroyed what slender encouragement she
might have drawn from the scene with
his child, to hope for some modification of
his resolution.</p>

<p>"Will you write to me, at regular intervals,
to give me news of Belle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if such is your wish."</p>

<p>"And yourself? you will be careful of
your health, will you not? And if I can
ever serve you in any way, you will let
me know?"</p>

<p>"It is not likely that you can; thank
you."</p>

<p>There was a silence of some moments.
Sarah stood playing with the tassel of her
morning robe, pale and composed.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" Lewis took her hand. "We
have both been hasty, both violent! Unfeeling
as you think me, and as I may
have seemed in this affair, believe me that
it almost kills me to part from you so
coldly. It is not like me to retract a determination,
but if you will say now what
you did last night&mdash;'Do not go!' I will stay,
and be as good a husband to you as I
can. Shall we not forgive, and try to forget?"</p>

<p>The demon of resentful pride was not so
easily exorcised. At a breath of repentance&mdash;a
suggestion of compromise, the fell
legion rallied an impregnable phalanx. She
was frozen, relentless; her eyes, black and
haughty, met his with an answer her
tongue could not have framed in words.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say!"</p>

<p>"'Nothing!' The ocean must then separate
us for years&mdash;it may be forever!"</p>

<p>"It was your choice. I will not reverse
it."</p>

<p>"Not if you knew that if you let me go
I would never return?"</p>

<p>"Not if I knew that you would never return!"</p>

<p>Without another word, without a farewell
look, or the hand-grasp mere strangers
exchange, he left her there&mdash;the stony
monument of her ill-directed life and affections;
the victim of a worldly mother
and a backbiting tongue!</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>"How gay Mrs. Hammond has grown
lately!" said Mrs. Greyling, the fashionable
critic of the &mdash;&mdash; House drawing-room.
"Do you see that she is actually waltzing
to-night? She moves well, too! That pearl-colored
moire antique is handsome, and
must have cost every cent of nine dollars
a yard. She is partial to heavy silks, it
seems. It gives an air of sameness to
her dress; otherwise she shows very tolerable
taste."</p>

<p>"I have heard it said that she was a
regular dowdy before she was married,"
observed Mrs. Parton, who was also on
the "committee of censure"&mdash;a self-appointed
organization, which found ample
employment in this crowded nest of pleasure-seekers.
"Her husband is perpetually
making her presents, and she dresses to
please him."</p>

<p>"Humph! I distrust these pattern
couples! 'My husband doesn't approve of
my doing this&mdash;won't hear of my acting
so!' are phrases easily learned, and sound
so fine that one soon falls into the habit
of using them. What a flirt Mrs. Benson
is! That is the fifth young man she has
danced with this evening. I pity her husband
and baby!"</p>

<p>"He does not look inconsolable! I tell
you what my notion is: he may love his
wife&mdash;of course he does&mdash;but he admires
her sister more. See how he watches her!
Mrs. Tomes told me that she was standing
near him the first time Mrs. Hammond
waltzed, and that he seemed real worried.
When the set was through, she came to
look for a seat, and he got one for her.
As she took it, he said something to her
which Mrs. Tomes could not hear, but she
laughed out in his face as saucy as could
be, and said: 'Oh, I am learning when I
am in Rome to do as Romans do! Doesn't
my elder sister set the example?'"</p>

<p>"He could say nothing then," said Mrs.
Greyling. "Those girls played their cards
well. The Hunts have very little, if anything,
besides the father's salary, and the
family was very obscure."</p>

<p>Mrs. Greyling's paternal progenitor was
an opulent soap-boiler, who was not
ashamed, during her childhood, to drive
an unsavory cart from one kitchen door
to another. But he counted his thousands
now by the hundred, and his children
ranked, as a consequence, among the "upper
ten."</p>

<p>She continued her charitable remarks:
"Somehow the old lady contrived to keep
up the appearance of wealth, and married
both daughters off before their second
season. Mr. Benson is reputed to be rich;
but for that matter these Southern planters
are all said to be rolling in money.
Mr. Hammond is certainly making money.
Mr. Greyling says he is a splendid business
man."</p>

<p>"He sailed for Europe a week ago, you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes; and since then madame has been
the belle of the ball. The old story&mdash;'When
the cat is away, the mice will
play.'"</p>

<p>"Sarah," said Philip, an hour later, "will
you walk on the balcony with me? You
are heated, and the air is balmy as Georgian
breezes. It will do you good."</p>

<p>"Are you going to scold me?" she asked,
archly, before she would take his arm.</p>

<p>"No. I have no right to do it if I had
the disposition."</p>

<p>There was no moon; but the sky was
strewed thickly with stars, and the white
foam of the surf caught and held tremulously
the sparkles from the bright watchers
above. Philip did not appear disposed
to converse, and Sarah waited for him to
begin. Meanwhile, they strolled on and on,
until the murmur of the ocean was louder
than the music of the saloon band. The
sea moaned to the stars, as it had done
to the sunless July heavens on that day
so memorable in the history of one of the
pair&mdash;the day of shipwreck stories and a
real shipwreck&mdash;none the less disastrous,
that the treasures and their loss were
hidden from all but the bereaved one.</p>

<p>To many it is appointed to lead two
lives; to think and feel as well as to act
a double part; to separate, as inexorably
as human will can decree, past hopes and
joys&mdash;past sorrows, and, if practicable,
past memories from the thoughts and emotions
of the to-day in which they exist.
Thousands keep up the barrier until death
ends the need of watchfulness and labor;
the coffin-lid covers the faithful mask that
has smiled so patiently and so long above
an aching heart. Yet dammed up passion
is a dangerous thing. If hearts were so
constituted that they could be drained
like pestilential marshes, the flood conducted
off in harmless and straight channels,
then, indeed, might hypocrisy rejoice,
and sleek decorum sit down at ease. As it
is, genteel propriety and refined reticence
are perpetually endangered by the unforeseen
swell of some intermittent spring, or
the thawing of some ice-bound stream,
that is liable to overleap or tear away the
dike&mdash;ingulfing in an instant the elaborate
structures years of toil have cheaply purchased.</p>

<p>Such was the moment when, withdrawing
her hand from Philip's arm, Sarah
struck suddenly&mdash;fiercely&mdash;upon her breast,
and cried: "Oh! why cannot I die and end
this misery!"</p>

<p>"Sarah!"</p>

<p>"I say I can bear it no longer! Others
do not suffer thus! If they do, they die,
or lose their reason. I will not endure it,
I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Sister!"</p>

<p>"Do not call me by that name, Philip
Benson! You know better!"</p>

<p>She leaned forward on the balcony railing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
her eyes fixed on the sea. Her deep, hurried
breathing was like the pant of some worried
animal, gathering strength, and, with
it, courage for renewed conflict. To her
last words the mysterious plaint of the
sea lent meaning. Philip, too, remembered
that barren shore, the tumbling breakers,
the solitary sea-bird's labored flight landward.
Was this his work? It was but a
flicker of truth&mdash;dashed out the next second
by a blow of indignant will.</p>

<p>"You may forbid me to address you by
this title, Sarah; but you cannot hinder
me from sympathizing with you in your sorrow,
and trying to befriend you. If my
companionship is unwelcome, allow me to
conduct you to your room. I cannot leave
you alone here, where there is continual
passing."</p>

<p>"You are right. Regard for appearances
is the one thing needful," she said, mockingly.
"I must be a dull scholar if I have
not learned that I am sane again now&mdash;fit to
associate with other sane people. If you
please, we will go to the ball-room instead
of upstairs. I am not a candidate
for solitary confinement yet!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hammond, I heard a gentleman
inquiring anxiously for you just now!"
called out a lady, in passing. "He said
that you promised to dance with him."</p>

<p>"I did. Thank you for reminding me.
A little faster, my good brother!"</p>

<p>She hurried him into the saloon, where
they were met immediately by her would-be
partner. Philip, bewildered and uneasy,
watched her through the evolutions of the
dance. She talked rapidly and animatedly,
keeping her cavalier in a broad smile, and
confirming her lately won reputation of
a wit. Her eyes shone; her color was
high; she was "really handsome"&mdash;as the
"censure committee" had occasion to remember
at a later day, when it was
spoken of in a very different tone from
that employed by a member of the distinguished
sisterhood in addressing Mrs.
Hunt on this night.</p>

<p>"You are a fortunate mother, my dear
madam, to have two such brilliant daughters.
They eclipse the girls entirely."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to complain of in my
children, ma'am. I done&mdash;I did my best
by them, and they have repaid me a thousandfold."</p>

<p>"Now, I am ready!" said Sarah, to her
brother-in-law. "I release you, Mr. Burley!"
waving her hand to her late attendant
as a princess might to a courtier.</p>

<p>Vexed and disturbed by her unsettled
manner and queer freaks, Philip gave
her his arm, and conducted her through
the throng.</p>

<p>"Lewis has had fair winds, and must
now be nearing the end of his voyage,"
he remarked, as they sauntered along the
piazza.</p>

<p>"Ah! he is on the sea to-night! How
strange! I had not thought of that!"</p>

<p>"I see nothing wonderful in the idea, as
he has not had time to cross the Atlantic
since he left these shores," returned Philip,
dryly. "The oddest thing I can think of at
present is yourself, Sarah!"</p>

<p>"I am aware of that, Philip. Do not
speak harshly to me! You may be sorry
for it some day."</p>

<p>They were at her door. Her softened
manner moved him, and as she offered her
hand, he took it with fraternal warmth.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, if I was rough! I have
not understood you this evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not likely that you ever will. Time
was&mdash;but it is folly to allude to that now!
Think of me as kindly as you can&mdash;will
you? You have wounded me sometimes,
but never knowingly. I cannot say that
of many others with whom I have had
dealings. Good-night."</p>

<p>The little parlor was still. Mrs. Hammond
never kept her maid up to assist in
her disrobing, if she intended remaining
out until a late hour. Nurse and child
were quiet in the adjacent nursery. Closing
the door of communication, Sarah
stripped her hair and arms of their ornaments;
took off her diamond pin, then her
rings, and laid them away in her jewelry
case; divested herself of her rich dress,
and drew from her wardrobe a plain, dark
wrapper, which she put on. Next she
sat down at her writing-desk, selected a
sheet of paper, and wrote a single line&mdash;when
a thought struck her, and she
stopped. A momentary irresolution ended
in her tearing off a strip containing what
she had penned, and holding it in the
flame of the lamp until it was consumed.
"Best not! best not!" she muttered.
"Doubt may bring comfort to the one or
two who will need it. Let them doubt!
Save appearances if you can, my poor
mother would say." A smile of unutterable
scorn glimmered over her face. She pushed
away the desk and walked to the window.</p>

<p>From the distant ball-room the throbbing
waves of music still rolled past on the
summer air, and blent with them was
the solemn undertone of the surf. Did men
call its mighty voice a monotone? To her
it was eloquent of many and awful things&mdash;not
frightful. What was there of terror
in thoughts of rest, endless sleep, rocked
for ages by the rising and falling tide,
hushed into dreamless repose by the music
of the billows? No more of a vain and
wearisome life; no more baffled aspirations
and crushed affections; no more disheartening
attempts to find and reach the right&mdash;to
follow in the steep, rugged path of
duty, and shun the easy, alluring way to
which heart and memory were ever pointing;
no more of stern rebuke and sneering
taunt; no more galled pride and outraged
womanhood; no more lying gayety, smiles,
and repartee, when the spirit was writhing
in impotent agony, longing to shriek out
its intensity of woe! Only sleep, rest,
peace!</p>

<p>"Sleep! rest peace!" She gasped the
words feverishly, as they seemed to come
to her on the breeze. Might she not
seek these now! now! Not yet! The
grounds, the beach were still populous
with groups of strollers. She would be
seen&mdash;perhaps recognized&mdash;probably frustrated
in her purpose. Leaning her head
against the casement, she sat there an
hour&mdash;not debating, still less wavering in
her resolve, only waiting until flight would
be safe&mdash;and thinking! thinking! thinking!
until her brain whirled.</p>

<p>A thwarted, warped, disjointed existence
had hers been from its beginning. Denied
food suitable for the mental and spiritual
need; denied sympathy, air, and expression
of suffering; under the slow torture of this
starvation, every avenue to goodness and
liberty hedged up, and, for the future,
temptation, repudiation, loneliness, perhaps
a sullied name&mdash;who could dispute
her right to try release by one brief pang
she alone could feel? Who would miss her?
Not the world that flattered her wealth
and wit, her laces, silks, and diamonds;
not the mother and sister who worshipped
the gilded Juggernaut "Society;" not he
who was that night sleeping soundly on
the same sea that would embosom her in
her sweeter, deeper slumber. Shocked he
might be at an event so unexpected and
uncommon. His next sensation would be
a relief at his deliverance from a burden,
at his freedom to come and go as he liked&mdash;no
longer banished by her obstinacy and
his own. He had loved her as most other
men do their wives&mdash;a bond too weak to
bear a heavy blow at their self-love. She
had sinned beyond forgiveness in his eyes.</p>

<p>Of Philip she thought with a mingling
of tenderness and resentment. His unthinking
gallantry had been the root of
her sorest trouble; but it was unthinking,
not wilful wrong. Nor was she the only
sufferer. His heart was well-nigh as hungry
as hers. Within the past week she
had seen this more clearly than ever before,
and he had felt it! Lucy's narrow
mind, her insipidity, her inordinate vanity,
her selfish idolatry of pleasures that
wearied him; her disrelish for intellectual
and domestic enjoyments, displayed in its
most objectionable form, in her indifference
to his company, and her neglect of her
child&mdash;these were working out their legitimate
result in his alienation from her, and
attraction towards the once slighted sister,
whose large heart and mental gifts
he now valued at their true worth. To
repel him, as much as to drown her cares,
Sarah had plunged into the vortex she had
heretofore avoided. She had heard that
there was temporary solace in this species
of dissipation. The cup was, for her,
sparkless and bitter, from surface to dregs.</p>

<p>She was saving him with herself by this
final step! He would realize this truth,
in the throe that would shake his soul
when he found she was gone; perhaps,
even in that anguished hour, would
bless her for having showed to him, while
she drove him back from, the abyss they
were together approaching. It was no
idle vaunt she had made to Lewis, that
the principles inherited from her father
would save her from overt sin. Thus,
thus would she flee the temptation, when
the heart had left the will to battle unaided.</p>

<p>Her father! the gray old man who was
toiling through this summer's heat, in his
deserted home, as he had through so many
summers gone! he who had never given
her an impatient or angry word&mdash;whose
pride and joy she still was! The stroke
would be severe upon him. Yet he would
not refuse comfort. There were still left
to him his boys&mdash;fine, manly fellows; Jeannie
and his baby grandchild&mdash;his lost
daughter's gift. Tears rushed into the hot,
wild eyes with this last image, but she
would not let them flow.</p>

<p>"Is it not better that I should leave her
now, when the parting will give her no
pain, when one little week will blot out my
memory entirely from her mind, than to
wait until she can recollect and miss me?"</p>

<p>The music had ceased. The revellers had
dropped away faster than they had collected,
when once the movement was made
to retire. The murmur of the deep was
the only sound abroad; the stars were
the only sentinels. Sarah arose, threw a
shawl over her head, and cautiously unlocked
the door. A strong rush of air
blew it from her hold, and as she caught
it, to draw it after her, she trod upon
some object lying on the floor. Mechanically
she stooped to pick it up. It was an
infant's shoe, a dainty little gaiter, that
peeped, during the day, from beneath
Baby Belle's white skirt. To Sarah's
touch it seemed that the lining still retained
the warmth of the child's foot.</p>

<p>Never, oh, never, was the patter of those
baby feet to make glad music for the
mother's ear! Others must guide and sustain
her trial steps; others smooth her
daily path; others direct the inexperience
of the girl in the perilous passes where
that mother had fallen and perished!</p>

<p>"Oh, may I not bless her before I leave
her forever?" she cried to stern Resolution.
And Conscience rejoined, with meaning
severity: "Is it you who would breathe
a blessing above her purity?"</p>

<p>"Suffer me, then, to take the farewell
look I dared not grant myself before!"</p>

<p>And while Resolution faltered at the
impassioned appeal, she opened the nursery
door and stole to the side of the crib.
The night-lamp shed a feeble halo over the
table whereon it stood. The rest of the
room was in darkness. Mary's light bedstead
was close to the crib. Was hers
that hard, short breathing, that sent a
start and chill through the hearer? A
touch to the lamp threw a blaze of light
over nurse and child. A sharp cry rang
through the chamber.</p>

<p>"Mary, Mary! get up!"</p>

<p>The girl sprang to the floor before she
comprehended the meaning of the alarm.
Mrs. Hammond had sunk into a chair
beside the crib, from which she had
snatched her infant. Baby Belle's head
was strained back; her hands clenched;
her limbs stiffened in a death-like spasm.
The eyes were rolled out of sight under
the lids; and the four little teeth&mdash;her
"most precious pearls," the fond mother
had called them&mdash;were hard-locked within
the purple lips.</p>

<p>Terrified as she was, Mary had the presence
of mind to run for assistance. Mrs.
Hunt and a physician were soon on the
spot, and every appliance of the healing
art that promised relief to the sufferer
was used, but with partial effect. Sarah
saw nothing but the child; heard nothing
but the doctor's calm orders.</p>

<p>"You do not try to help her!" she said,
impatiently, as a convulsion, more fearful
than any that had preceded it, seized the
delicate frame.</p>

<p>"I could not do more, were it my own
child, madam!"</p>

<p>He was an elderly man, whose charity
for fashionable mothers was very scant,
and, having seen Mrs. Hammond in the
ball-room the evening before, he was not
prepared for the solicitude she manifested.</p>

<p>"You had better let the nurse take her!"
he said, more gently, as Sarah, with difficulty,
held down the struggling hands
that might do hurt to the head and face.</p>

<p>"No! I will have no one touch her but
myself!"</p>

<p>The morning broke, the day heightened
into noon, and the paroxysms only
abated in violence as the babe's strength
declined. Steadfast to her word, the
mother had not once resigned her. She
had herself immersed her in the warm
baths, applied the poultices, and administered
the medicines prescribed. Mrs.
Hunt was compassionate and active; Mary
sorrowful, and prompt with whatever service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
she could perform; Lucy frightened
and idle.</p>

<p>Philip, who had often been in the outer
room to make inquiries and offer aid, if
any were required of him, was told, just
before sunset, that he could go into the
chamber. Mrs. Hunt invited him, and the
information she added gave to his countenance
a look of heartfelt sadness as he
followed her. Sarah sat in the middle of
the room, so altered that he could scarcely
credit the fact of her identity with the
being he had parted from the previous
night. Her eyes were sunken, her features
sharpened, and her complexion had the
dead, grayish hue of an old woman's. In
her arms lay the babe, and, as she
crouched over it, her mien of defiant protection
suggested to him the idea of a
savage animal guarding her young. He
could not say whether or not she was
aware of his presence, until he knelt by
the dying child and called it by name.</p>

<p>"Baby Belle, do you know Uncle Philip?"</p>

<p>The dark eyes, soft still through the
gathering film, moved slightly, and Sarah
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak to her again!"</p>

<p>"Will Baby Belle come to uncle?"</p>

<p>This time there was no sign of consciousness.
The wee hands clasped in the
mother's grew colder and colder, and the
breath fluttered slowly through the parted
lips. The end was near, and Philip's pitying
accent expressed his sense of this.</p>

<p>"Give her to me, dear Sarah! It is not
right for you to keep her longer."</p>

<p>"She is mine!"</p>

<p>The glare that came to her eye with the
three words revealed a desperation that
would have done battle with the King of
Terrors, had he appeared in visible shape
to claim his victim.</p>

<p>More faintly, slowly, trembled the life
over the sweet mouth, and the hands, like
waxen shapes, lay pulseless in the mother's
clasp; while through the silent room
flowed the dirge of the sea. Shaken by
the freshening breeze of evening, the
shutters of the western window swung
ajar, letting in a golden ray upon mother
and child, and along that path of light
the untarnished soul of Baby Belle was
borne by its waiting angel&mdash;home!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Aunt Sarah sat in the wide porch at the
back of her house, knitting in hand. It
was a still, but not oppressive August
afternoon. There was not a ruffle on the
bright surface of the river, and the long
meadow grass was as smoothly spread out
in the yellow sunshine. From the poultry-yard
on the left arose a pleasant murmur,
and now and then a stray hen tiptoed
around the end of the house, singing
idly as she rambled. Charley lay on the
green mound&mdash;his old reading-room&mdash;with
a book before him, and to him Aunt
Sarah's motherly eyes turned most frequently.
Those kindly orbs were dimmer
than they were two summers ago, and the
gentle face was a thought more pensive.
A glance into the sitting-room window,
from where she sat, would have showed
one Uncle Nathan's empty arm-chair in the
chimney corner, and above it were suspended
his cane and broad-brimmed hat,
just as he had put them off when he took
his departure for a country where neither
shelter nor staff is needed. Aunt Sarah's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
cap had a widow's border now; and in
her faithful heart there was a sadder void
than the death of her children had created&mdash;loving
parent though she was&mdash;and yet
more plentiful springs of sympathy for
others bereaved and suffering.</p>

<p>Her rocking-chair was set near the entrance
of the hall that bisected the dwelling;
and the front and back doors being
open, she had a fair view of the public
road, whenever she chose to look up the
lane. The Shrewsbury stage met the boat
at four o'clock, or soon after; and hearing
a rumbling along the highway, which she
knew presaged its transit through this
end of the village, the old lady leaned
forward to catch a glimpse of the trunks
upon the roof; this being all she could distinguish
with certainty above the fence.</p>

<p>"Why, it is stopping here!" she ejaculated,
getting up to obtain a better look.
"Who upon earth can it be?"</p>

<p>The coach rolled on, and the passenger
for the farm-house came through the gate
and down the lane. She was dressed in
black, wore a crape veil, and carried a
small hand-trunk. With a hospitable instinct,
Aunt Sarah advanced to the front
porch to meet her, still entirely in the dark
as to who it could be.</p>

<p>"She has a different look from any of
the neighbors; and there's nobody in York
that would be likely to come to see me,
except Betsy's people, and it can't be
either of her girls!"</p>

<p>At this stage of her cogitations, the
visitant reached the step on which the
hostess stood, and put away the long veil
from a face so worn and seamed with
grief, so hollow-eyed and old, that the
good aunt screamed outright in her distressed
astonishment&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sarah, dear child! can this be you?"</p>

<p>"What I am now, Aunt Sarah. May I
come in and stay with you a little while?"</p>

<p>"Stay with me, poor darling! As long as
you like, and welcome! Come right in;
you don't look fit to stand!"</p>

<p>She was not; for, now that the necessity
for exertion was removed, she was faint
and trembling. Aunt Sarah helped her upstairs
to the room she had occupied at her
former visit, undressed her, and put her
to bed. Sarah submitted like a child, too
much exhausted to resist being made an
invalid of, or to offer any explanation of
her singular apparition. She had not slept
an hour at a time for many nights; yet
when she had drunk a cup of tea, and
tried to eat a bit of toast her aunt prepared
and brought up to her, she fell into
a profound slumber, which lasted until
long after sunrise on the following morning.
Unclosing her eyes then, they rested
upon the dear face, shaded by the widow's
cap, that watched at her bedside. A shadowy
phantom of a smile flitted over her
features at the recognition.</p>

<p>"It was not a dream, then?" she said
languidly. "But I have dreamed of you
often, of late&mdash;every night in which I have
had any sleep. Aunt Sarah, I must tell
you why I came to you!"</p>

<p>"Not now, dear," Aunt Sarah hastened to
say, seeing the wild stare and the cloud
return to her countenance. "Wait until
you are stronger. I will bring up your
breakfast, and when you have eaten it,
you may try to dress, if you like. There
will be time enough for your story, by-and-by.
Charley is in a great fidget to see
you."</p>

<p>Sarah submitted to the delay; but it was
plain that she was not satisfied with it,
and that her mind would be easier when
once the tale was told. Aunt Sarah hindered
her no longer a time than sufficed
for her to take the much needed refreshment,
to bathe and dress, and to see and
exchange a few sentences with Charley,
who supported her down to the sitting-room.
There, resting among the pillows
of the lounge, Aunt Sarah beside her, with
the ubiquitous knitting-work in hand, lest
too close observation should confuse her
niece, the stricken one unfolded the whole
of her sad history.</p>

<p>No more affecting proof could have been
given of her prostrated mind and will than
this unreserved recital. The secret she had
sold conscience and liberty to preserve,
she communicated now without a blush.
Here&mdash;where she had formed the intimacy
that had shadowed so darkly her after
days&mdash;she detailed every step of the wrong
course to which this weakness was a
key; went over all&mdash;the stormy parting
with her husband; her conviction of the
mutual peril she and Philip were tempting
in their daily communion; her resolve of
self-destruction&mdash;as circumstantially as if
she were relating the biography of another.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah, horrified and pitiful by
turns, struggled with indifferent success to
maintain equal composure, and against
growing doubts of the narrator's sanity.
It was a striking and instructive contrast:
the world-weary woman returning for consolation
and advice to the simple-minded
matron, to whom the artificial existence
she now heard depicted&mdash;its gilded vices
and giddy round of vanities; its trials and
temptations&mdash;were a wonderful, a monstrous
tale, as foreign to her sphere of principles
and feelings as if they had transpired in
another world. But when Sarah came to
speak of her child, her manner changed,
her voice was hoarse and uneven, and
over the careworn visage there went such
alterations of fierceness and heart-breaking
sorrow that the listening mother, upon
whose soul the shadow of her own children's
graves still lay long and dark, could
hear no more in silence.</p>

<p>"My poor girl!" she cried, falling on her
knees, and throwing her arms around the
reclining figure. "Dear child! Our Father
in heaven pity and comfort you! There
is no help in man for such trouble as
yours!"</p>

<p>Sarah had not shed a tear in the course
of her story. She said afterwards that
she had not wept since they took her dead
baby from her clasp; but at this burst of
unfeigned sympathy, this gush of pure
love and compassion, the burning rock was
cleft, and a blessed flood streamed from
it. For some minutes they wept together
without restraint, and when the more quiet
grief of the elder mourner was repressed,
the other still clung, sobbing to her bosom.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah held and soothed her as she
would have done a sorrowful child; stroking
away the hair from her forehead,
drying and kissing the tear-stained cheeks,
with many an epithet of fond reassurance.</p>

<p>"Let me finish! There is very little
more!" resumed Sarah, keeping her aunt's
hand fast in both of hers. "We went back
to the city, and the next day we laid her in
Greenwood. We stayed at father's&mdash;I
would not return to the house that used
to be mine. Father was very kind, and
mother meant to be; but she tormented
me with suggestions and consultations
about my black clothes. Lucy was pining
to get back to Newport. She said it was
hot and dull in New York. Philip wanted
to comfort me, but I shunned him, and I
think he was hurt by my conduct; but
it was best, was it not, Aunt Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear!"</p>

<p>"I had often imagined myself lonely before;
but I never dreamed of such a horror
of desolation as filled my soul during the
two days that I remained there, after all
was over. Twenty times each night I
would start from a feverish doze, thinking
that I heard my baby cry or moan as she
did in the intervals of those awful convulsions;
and then would come in upon
me, as if I had never felt it until then,
the truth that I could never see her again,
and that my wicked, wicked intention of
deserting her had brought this judgment
upon me. I could not stay there, Aunt
Sarah! I heard other voices besides my
child's in the air, and saw strange, grinning
faces in the darkness. But the worst
was to see that, to every one but me, the
world was the same that it had ever been.
Father looked grave when I was in his
sight; but the children could laugh and
talk as if nothing had happened, and I
have seen mother and Lucy chattering
merrily in the room with the dressmaker
over my new dresses, while they were
criticizing the crape trimmings. And I
had buried my last earthly hope in my
baby's grave! Then I remembered you,
and how you had talked to me of your lost
children, and how you had assured me of
a home in your heart and house whenever
I chose to claim it, and I believed in you,
Aunt Sarah! There are not many whom
I do trust; but I was sure you never said
what you did not mean. I would not tell
them that I was coming for I feared they
would prevent me. I slipped out of the
house when none of them were at home,
and went to the nearest hack-stand, where
I got into a carriage and drove down to
the boat."</p>

<p>"My dear, did you leave no letter to let
them know where you had gone?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. I was afraid they would
come or send for me, and I cannot go
back."</p>

<p>"But your father&mdash;your mother! Did you
not think how distressed they would be
when they missed you? And your reputation?
What will be said when it's known
that you have left your father's house,
and no one knows where you are? You are
very weak and tired, dear; but you must
sit up, right away, and write a note home.
Tell them that I will take care of you
as long as you like to stay with me, but
don't lose a minute! You may be in time
for the afternoon boat."</p>

<p>Sarah obeyed; and the careful old lady
hurried Charley off to the boat, with directions
to place the billet in the hands of
the captain, who was a personal friend,
and could be relied upon to post it directly
he reached the city.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunt replied without delay. Sarah's
absence had given rise to the most harrowing
conjectures, made plausible by her
extreme melancholy and fitful behavior
since her infant's death. The police had
been privately notified of her disappearance,
and cautiously worded advertisements
inserted in the papers. He regretted
to add that Mr. Marlow, who, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Mr. Hammond's nearest friend, was informed
of the distressing occurrence, had
thought proper to communicate the intelligence
to Mr. H. before Sarah's note arrived,
and the steamer bearing the letter
had sailed. Mr. Hunt expressed himself
as entirely willing that his daughter should
remain in her present retreat until her
health of mind and body was re-established,
but did not conceal his disapprobation
of the manner of her leaving home.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah looked concerned as she read
this epistle, which her niece had passed
over to her.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for your husband, my dear.
This affliction, coming so close upon the
other, will be a dreadful blow. It is a
pity they did not wait awhile, until they
knew something of your whereabouts, before
writing to him.</p>

<p>"I am more sorry that the news must
be contradicted," was the reply. "As we
are now situated, the certainty of my
death would be a relief to him. This was
my reflection that night"&mdash;She left the
sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"My dear!" Aunt Sarah removed her
spectacles, and surveyed her niece with
her kind, serious eyes. "Have you made
up your mind to live separate from your
husband for the rest of your life?"</p>

<p>"What else should I do, aunt? He will
never come back unless I promise to love
him, and that cannot be."</p>

<p>"That doesn't alter the fact of your
duty, as I look at it. You ought to make
him an offer to do right, at any rate. It
would have been easier and pleasanter to
live with him, if you had felt for him as a
woman should for the man she marries;
but you are married to him, and in the
sight of the Lord you ought to cleave to
him, and him only. That is a solemn covenant,
dear&mdash;'for richer, for poorer; for
better, for worse!' 'Those whom God hath
joined together, let not man put asunder!'
It doesn't excuse people, who take these
vows upon them when the right spirit is
wanting, that they never thought how
awful the engagement was. Their obligations
are just the same, whether they love
or not."</p>

<p>"The responsibility does not rest with
me. I performed my duty while we were
together. The separation was his act, and
he must abide the consequences. I have
erred greatly, Aunt Sarah; but ever since
the night of our rupture, my conscience
has been easy with respect to Mr. Hammond.
I confessed that I had misled him,
and begged his pardon. Could I do more?"</p>

<p>"Put the case to yourself, child! Do not
be angry if I speak out my mind, and
use against you some things you have told
me. When you saw that Philip was growing
to like you better and better, and that
you felt nearer to him every day, why did
you determine to die sooner than to have
things go on so?"</p>

<p>"Because it would have been a crime
for us to love each other&mdash;infamous treachery
to my sister, to his wife, for us to
name the word between us."</p>

<p>"And how would Lucy have felt, if you
had come to an understanding and spoken
out the true feeling of your hearts?"</p>

<p>"Hers is a careless, indolent nature, but
this insult would have aroused her. She
would never have forgiven him or me,
had she suspected a warmer sentiment
on either side than that of friendship."</p>

<p>"But an honorable, affectionate man like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
your husband, who thought his wife the
most precious thing in the world, was to
forget his disappointment, overlook your
lack of love and truth towards him, only
because you allowed that he had found
out your real feelings at last, and all the
excuse you could give was that you could
not help them! You were the one in fault
all the way through, from the day you
engaged to marry him, up to the minute
when you would not say the word he
begged from you to keep him at home.
It is right that all the advance should
come from you."</p>

<p>High-spirited as Sarah was, she was not
angered by this plain-speaking. "Faithful
are the wounds of a friend;" and she felt
that she had but this one. Aunt Sarah
studied her thoughtful countenance before
she renewed the argument.</p>

<p>"I am an old-fashioned woman, dear&mdash;born
and bred in the country, where, thank
God! I have spent all my life. But I've
been thinking about your story of the way
people act and feel up there in York, and
maybe in all other great, fine, money-making
cities, and my notion is just this.
I look back of their pushing and straining
after riches, and show, and worldly vanities;
every man for himself, and the one
that climbs highest, forgetting as soon as
he gets there that he was ever any lower,
and ready to kick over anybody that tries
to get alongside of him; and I see that
they have lost sight of the second great
commandment&mdash;'Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself.' Then I look back of this
too, and I see where the greatest sin is,
and&mdash;dear, bear with me! I see where
you have gone furthest astray. Here's a
passage I was reading this morning that
tells the whole story." She raised the
Bible from the table, and laid it upon
Sarah's lap, pointing as she did so to
these words enclosed in brackets:</p>

<p>"Because thou hast forgotten the God
of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful
of the rock of thy strength, therefore
shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt
set it with strange slips. In the day thou
shalt make thy plant to grow, and in the
morning shalt thou make thy seed to
flourish; but the harvest shall be a heap
in the day of grief and desperate sorrow!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt would have regarded as an insult
any expressed doubt of her religious
principles and practice. She had a desirable
pew in the fashionable church which
was nearest her residence, and, stormy
Sabbaths excepted, it was generally full
at morning service. When her children
were presentable as to looks, very young
babies being seldom pretty, they were offered
in fine lawn and Valenciennes at
the font for the rite of baptism; and not
a confirmation had passed since her daughters
were grown, that she did not fancy
how interesting they would look, kneeling
before the surpliced bishop, heads gracefully
bowed, and the regards of the whole
congregation fixed upon them. Sarah
never could be brought to the performance
of the commonest act of public worship,
unless it was to rise with the rest, when
a standing posture was prescribed by the
prayer-book; and she shocked her mother
by declaring that she only did this because
she was tired of sitting! Lucy's
serene grace of devoutness was beautiful,
if not edifying to behold. Those who occupied
adjacent pews involuntarily suppressed
their responses as her mellow
tones repeated, with melancholy sweetness&mdash;"Have
mercy upon us, miserable sinners!"
And as the melting cadences entranced
their ears, the lovely penitent was
speculating upon the probable cost of Miss
Hauton's Parisian hat, or coveting Mrs.
Beau Monde's sable cloak.</p>

<p>If Sarah had even heard of regeneration,
it was as a technical phrase of the church
articles and christening service. Of its
practical meaning, its inward application,
its absolute necessity to the safety of the
soul, she had as vague a conception as a
Parsee or New Zealand cannibal would
have formed. She had read the Bible in
connection with rhetorical lectures, and
admired it as a noble specimen of Oriental
literature. What other associations could
she have with it? A handsome copy of the
Holy Scriptures, surmounted by a book
of common prayer, lay on a stand in Mrs.
Hunt's third and rear parlor, and was
dusted when a like attention was paid to
the other ornaments of tables and etageres.
An Oxford edition, russet antique, formed
one of the wedding-gifts of each of the
sisters, and in due time was laid in pious
pomp on its purple pillow in the library
corner. It was hardly strange, then, that
the quotation, so apposite to the case in
point, should fail to impress her very
strongly. Aunt Sarah had gone out, deeming
solitary reflection the best means of
enforcing the lesson she had tried to inculcate,
and, after re-reading the two
verses, without further appropriation of
their meaning, Sarah turned leaf after leaf
of the volume, catching here and there a
sentence of the large print, so grateful to
the failing sight of her who was its daily
student.</p>

<p>"David said unto his servants&mdash;'Is the
child dead?' And they said, 'He is dead!'"</p>

<p>The smitten chord in the mother's heart
sent out a ring of pain, and her listless
hand paused upon the open page. It is a
simple story&mdash;the royal parent's unavailing
wrestle with the Chastener, the dread end
of his suspense, and the affliction, made
manifest in the calm resignation, the sanctified
trust of the mourner. But when
received as Sarah read it, with the vision
of a similar death-scene intermixing itself
with its unadorned details, the fresh blood
still welling from the wound made by the
tearing away of a portion of one's own
life, every line is fraught with truth and
pathos.</p>

<p>"Can I bring him back again? I shall
go to him, but he shall not return to me!"</p>

<p>"Go to her! Oh, if I could! My baby!
my baby!"</p>

<p>To the low, sad cry succeeded a season of
yearning and of tears. It was an echo of
the wail of the heathen mother who, centuries
ago, having seen her babes slain before
her eyes, cried aloud, in unselfish
agony, as the sword, reeking with their
blood, was plunged into her own bosom&mdash;"Oh,
my children! where are ye?"</p>

<p>Sleep on, in thy lowly bed upon the hillside,
sweet Baby Belle! Like the pale
buds that are fading with thee in thy narrow
resting-place, thy mission on earth is
accomplished. Joy, young freed spirit, if,
stealing through the melodies of heaven,
there comes to thee the whisper of that
mother's call! Fair lamb! the love that
folded thee in the Shepherd's arms designed
likewise, in recalling thee, to lure
the wandering parent home!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p>"My Dear Lewis: Before you receive this letter,
you will have had the explanation of my disappearance
from New York. A merciful Providence
directed me, in my partial derangement, to this
peaceful retreat. Here I have found rest for body
and soul&mdash;peace such as the world could never
give the heart, even were it not bowed down by
a sorrow like mine. Not that I forget past errors;
nor that the review does not humble me in the
dust. I confess, with shame and bitterness of
spirit, my wasted years, my unsanctified affections,
my evil passions. But for the assurance of the
Father's pardon, the Saviour's loving pity, the
black catalogue would strike me dead with horror
and anguish. It is a fearful thing to be made to
see one's self as she is; to scan in terrified solicitude
the record of a life, and find there nothing
better than pride, misanthropy, falsehood, hatred
of men&mdash;rebellion against God. It is a sweet experience
to taste, however tremblingly, the consolations
of the Friend who invites the weary and
heavy-laden to draw near and learn of Him. In
His strength&mdash;not in that feebleness I once called
power&mdash;have I resolved to lead a new life. Of the
causes which have contributed to produce this
change, we will speak more at length when we
meet.</p>

<p>"'When we meet!' Lewis, will you, can you
forget your manifold wrongs and come back to me?
I do not plead, now, 'for the sake of our child.'
Her sinless soul henceforth can know no pain or
woe. God saw that I was not worthy of her, and
He took her. In the earlier weeks of my selfish
mourning, I had no thought of your bereavement.
Latterly, I have longed to comfort you, for I
know that your heart is riven by this stroke. She
was your joy, as she was my angel of peace. Her
loss is our common sorrow. Shall it not draw us
together? Yet, as I have said, our estrangement
cannot now affect her. Thoughtless of evil, she
passed away. Had she lived, the Omniscient only
knows what grief and mortification might have
darkened her pathway. Nor do I desire a reconciliation
as a shield from the world's sneer or ban.
I hold its applause and its censure alike cheaply.
In prosperity, its favors were painted, tasteless
fruit; in adversity, it would have fed my starving
heart with husks. But for my sake&mdash;by the
thought of my late and sore repentance; by the
remorse that must gnaw my spirit, when I remember
your noble trust in me, your unswerving fidelity,
your generous love and my base requital of it
all; by the sorrow that never leaves me by day or
by night&mdash;forgive me, and return to the home we
have both forsaken! I will serve you very faithfully,
my husband! I have gained other and higher
views of the marriage relation within a short time
past. However presumptuously I may have assumed
its responsibilities, however unworthily I
performed its duties in former days, I would enter
upon our re-engagement with a solemn sense of
what I owe to you and to Him who united us.
You must have despised me at our parting, and
since. Perhaps you have come to think of me with
dislike as well as contempt. I will bear this&mdash;grievous
though the burden will be&mdash;as a part of
my righteous punishment. I will never murmur&mdash;never,
even in thought, accuse you of unjust harshness,
if you will grant me the opportunity to make
what amends I can for all you have lost and suffered
through my fault."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sarah was still far from strong; and wearied as
much by the intensity of her feelings as by the
manual effort of writing, she laid the pen down,
and leaned back in the cushioned chair. Her table
stood in the parlor beneath the window overlooking
the river. The room was prim and clean, as of
yore, with its straight lines of chairs; its shining
specks of mirrors; the grim black profiles above
the mantel, and the green boughs in the fireplace.
The outer scene was in its general features, that
which the girl had surveyed, with pleased surprise,
the July evening of her arrival here two years ago.</p>

<p>Only two years! The sufferings and life-lessons
of twenty had been crowded into that brief space.
The meadows were growing sere, as if scorching
winds had swept over them, and the stream reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
truthfully, yet, one could have fancied,
sadly, the changing foliage fringing its borders.
But the sky, with its tender blue and its fleecy
clouds, ever shifting, yet ever retaining their likeness
to one another&mdash;the river's smooth, steady
flow, were the same; fit emblems both of them of
counsels which are mercy and truth through all
their workings; of love that abideth forever!</p>

<p>The train of thought was replete with refreshing
to the spirit that was striving, in prayer and watchfulness,
to adhere to the right, to accept, with
meek submission, all that her cup yet held of
pungent or nauseous lees. There was no affectation
in the humble tone of her letter. She would
not begin it until she had mastered the stubborn
remnant of her native pride. It should be nothing
to her that her husband had wilfully separated
himself from her, and refused her overtures of
reconcilement. If this was unkindness it was all
she could reproach him with in the course of time
they had spent together. He had been a true
friend, an honorable protector, and dimly still, but
more justly than ever before, she perceived that
into his love for her there had entered none of the
merely prudential considerations, the cool calculations,
wherewith she used to account for his choice
of herself as a helpmeet. Where, in the world's
heartless circles, could she point out another wife
as much indulged, as much honored in public and
in private, as she once was by him? Mournfully,
if not lovingly, she dwelt upon the countless evidences
of his cordial fulfillment, in letter and in
spirit, of his part of their mutual engagement, with
something of the sinking heart the alchemist may
have felt when, after he had, by a mechanical and
habitual fling of his arm, tossed the eagerly-sought
philosopher's stone into the sea as a worthless
pebble, he discovered that the divining steel he
held had been changed to gold by its touch.</p>

<p>To whom of us has not an experience similar to
this come? It may be that the eyes which once
besought affection with dumb and disregarded eloquence
are closed and rayless for all future time;
the lips that told, with modest frankness, how dear
we were to hearts we cared not then to win, are
now but silent dust. Or, perchance, grieved by
indifference, repelled by unkindness, those hearts
have sought and found in other loves solace for the
pain we, in our blindness inflicted. It matters little
whether they be dead to all the world, or only
to us. In either case, the longing and despair of
our lonely lives are rendered the more unendurable
from the flash of tardy truth that shows us, side
by side with our actual poverty of heart riches, the
tranquil beauty of the pictured "might have been."</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah had gone on a visit to a neighbor;
the hired girl was in the distant wash-house; and
Charley considered it his duty to linger within
easy reach of his cousin, should she need him for
any purpose. To guard her from all chance of intrusion,
he stationed himself on the front porch
steps, with his book on his knee. For an hour he
read on uninterruptedly; then, glancing up as he
turned a leaf, he saw a gentleman coming down
the gravel walk. He looked thin and anxious, and
his restless eye wandered from door to windows, as
in expectation of seeing some one beside the boy.
With a ready apprehension of his infirmity, only to
be accounted for by some prior knowledge of the
person he saluted, he took from his pocket a card,
which he presented before he shook hands with the
silent host. Charley's intelligent face was one
beam of pleasure as he read, and his warm grasp
showed his sympathy in the happiness he fancied
was in store for his cousin. Inviting the guest by
a gesture to follow him, he went softly to the parlor-door,
tapped lightly&mdash;too lightly, indeed, to attract
the notice of the musing occupant of the
room, then drew back the bolt, admitted the
stranger, and delicately withdrew.</p>

<p>Sarah heard the door open and Charley's retreating
footsteps, and, supposing that he had peeped
in to see that she was comfortable and wanted for
nothing, she did not look around. The intruder
stood still one step within the room, as if unable
to advance or speak. The languid attitude of the
figure before him, so unlike the self-poise and
quiet energy of her former deportment, her black
dress, even the wasted hands dropped so wearily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
upon her lap, told of the storm that had passed
over her, the utter revolution in her life and
nature. A struggling sigh he could not repress
broke from the gazer's breast, and Sarah turned
hastily towards him. She did not swoon, as he
feared she would. A thrill, like an electric shock,
shook her from head to foot; a wild inquiry looked
from her eyes; a question or the reality of the
appearance, succeeding so closely to&mdash;did it grow
out of her revery?</p>

<p>Lewis put this imagination to flight.</p>

<p>"Sarah!" he said, pressing in his the hands she
extended mutely. "They told me you were lost,
and I hurried home to find you. I could not wait
for your permission to come to you, when I learned
in New York that I had a living wife! The loss
of the child was heavy enough; but this"&mdash;He
could say no more.</p>

<p>"I am thankful! I am glad that you are here!"
A faint, beautiful smile shone over her wan features.
"And our baby, Lewis! We must remember
that she is an angel now!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>To no one except Aunt Sarah were the facts of
the estrangement and reconciliation of her relatives
ever revealed, and within her faithful bosom the
secret was hidden as securely as in a tomb.</p>

<p>Great was the chagrin of gossips, male and
female, when it was known that Mrs. Hammond's
strange flight from her father's house, which had
leaked out nobody knew how, and been variously
construed into an elopement, a freak of derangement,
and a deliberate intention of suicide, according
to the degrees of charity possessed by the
theorists, was a very innocent and unromantic
journey to the country home of her favorite aunt
and godmother, a lady of ample fortune and
benevolent heart, who would, in all probability,
make her namesake her heiress. Under her care,
and for the benefit of the seclusion so congenial
to one in her affliction, and the salt air so necessary
for the restoration of her impaired health,
Mrs. Hammond had remained until her husband's
return from abroad.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hunt had told Mrs. A., who had told Mrs.
B., who repeated it to Mrs. C., how he had not
stopped in New York an hour after he stepped
ashore from the "Adriatic." He hurried to the
bank, and ascertained from Mr. Hunt that his wife
was with her aunt, and that a boat which would
land him near Shrewsbury was to leave in fifteen
minutes. So he drove down post-haste, and jumped
on board of her after the plank had been drawn
and the wheels began to move. There never was
a more devoted husband or a more attached pair,
Mrs. Hunt affirmed.</p>

<p>"More than she could say for that flirting Mrs.
Benson and her other half," agreed A., B. and C.,
unanimously.</p>

<p>"Her conduct at Newport was scandalous, and
would have been outrageous if he had not watched
her like a lynx!" said Mrs. Beau Monde, who had
never been able to secure one-half as many admirers
as had Lucy, and hated her as honestly as
if they were a couple of Biddies pulling caps for
Patrick or Murphy.</p>

<p>"I don't see why he should have felt jealous, I
am sure. He wasn't dying of love for her! That
could be seen with half an eye. They say he loved
Mrs. Hammond before he addressed her sister, and
married this one out of spite," rejoined Mrs.
Townes, who had made beaux yeux at the distingue
Southerner for three whole evenings, and won only
the most indifferent glances in requital.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hammond behaved very prudently!" pronounced
Mrs. Greyling, "and dressed very well. I
suppose Mr. Hammond brought her some elegant
things from abroad. Pity she is in mourning, and
must dress plainly at present! If I were in her
place&mdash;as it was only a baby&mdash;I would not wear
black more than six months, unless it was very
becoming."</p>

<p>"She has become very religious, you know,"
said Mrs. Parton.</p>

<p>"Indeed! People are apt to, I think, when
there has been death in the family," concluded
Mrs. Greyling, pensively. "I remember, when my
poor sister died, I used to look forward to church
and Sunday with real pleasure. I could not go
anywhere on week-days, you know, although there
were piles of tickets lying in my card-receiver, and
we had just taken a box at the opera that very
winter! I declare, I should have lost the run of
the fashions entirely, and forgotten people's faces,
if I had not gone to church. I dare say, too,
that she finds some comfort in religion&mdash;poor
woman! if what the preachers and good books tell
us be true."</p>

<p>Had Sarah found comfort?</p>

<p>Look we, for reply, to the chastened lustre of
the eye, where once burned restless fires, like the
sunward gaze of the imprisoned eagle; to the holy
serenity struggling through and finally dispelling
the clouds of memory and regret that, at times,
would roll in between her soul and the bright, sustaining
hope upon which Faith would have its regards
forever fixed; to her daily life, sanctified by
prayer, beneficent in good works, and by its unostentatious
loveliness winning others, first to admire,
then to imitate; to the wifely submission and
loving kindness of her bearing to her husband, her
grateful estimate of the affection he lavished upon
her, the deep, true tenderness growing up in her
heart for this fond and noble companion; look we,
lastly, to the snowy marble guarding that tiny
mound in Greenwood, where the mother once believed
that hope and joy were buried to know no
awakening.</p>
